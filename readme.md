# Play (Play) `Play();`

> "The repeat may be an exact replica of first statement or it may present an element of variation."
> — Samuel Beckett

Samuel Beckett's 1963 one-act "Play (Play)” concludes with the instruction "[REPEAT PLAY]”. This piece extends that instruction using natural language processing via large-language-models (GPT2, and GPT3 from OpenAI) into unbounded time. Each variation is unique, generated live, and will never be recreated exactly. Performers and audience members are invited to participate in a reading by picking up a copy of the script.

The original dialogue, smacking of melodrama, has a dreamlike universal quality of minds trapped floating in the collective unconscious. By incorporating large-language-model based text-generation in to the play, the collective unconsciousness of the characters is extended into sphere of idiosyncratic "natural language" that comes from the training data fueling the models. A sense of shame and bewilderment of Beckett's high-modernist subjects gives way to the delirium of the 21st century digital morass.

This code powers a video and performance installation to be staged in collaboration with the artist. A video feed displays the output of the "Display App" which communicates via OSC with the python code that iteratively generates new scripts variations.
