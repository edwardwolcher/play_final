# Play (Play) `Play();`

> "The repeat may be an exact replica of first statement or it may present an element of variation."
> â€” Samuel Beckett

This code powers a video and performance installation to be staged in collaboration with the artist. A video feed displays the output of the "Display App" which communicates via OSC with the python code that iteratively generates new scripts variations on Samuel Beckett's 1963 one-act entitled "Play (Play)"

In Beckett's script the instruction "[REPEAT PLAY]" is found as a stage direction near the end, with notes to explore variations on repetition. This project extends that into arbitrary time by producing an unbounded number of variations.

The original dialogue, smacking of melodrama, has a dreamlike universal quality of minds trapped floating in the collective unconscious. By incorporating large-language-model based text-generation in to the play, the collective unconsciousness of the characters is extended into sphere of idiosyncratic "natural language" that comes from the training data fueling the models. A sense of shame and bewilderment of Beckett's high-modernist subjects gives way to the delirium of the 21st century digital morass.
