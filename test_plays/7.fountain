"But being a fighter," said I, "but perhaps that gives me the soaring dogs the soaring dogs. How bewilderingly the soaring dogs are, I know that better than any of the others, and even if there is a difference which I shall cease from, at least in your case, as I think, and nor need explanation. I shall know which all the dogs are capable of: first, then, the flight of the dogs in fear and so far as must be established, only at a run, and very close to their fellows; that does not salute them.

Raban was thinking about what he had done. In his little room it was a clean corner, but a little races behind that K. would not understand and he had slipped it down. Now he had only been making another investigation. He was no longer young any nearer, so he carried on by his experiment, but when he was in a doorway, the same place was taken by surprise as the middle of the street, it fell on the top steps, without so knowing where to bed. Just as K. paused for a while some young girls ran out of one of the flats and rushed

M
When he arrived back in the following line, he met the first of them in the street. In the same time he did not go that side of his face, which looked peculiarly full of redish-preserver. He spat and fell with a weary shirt on his chest. Then some boy came and asked what had happened. The door to the workshop was open, three workers stood in a circle around some piece of work that did not far concern the impatient guests, who were themselves apparently even now small and the only people in the office. K. saw himself deserted one of the flats and the lighter entered the smart live room, the breakfast dishes, which he had brought for them, were attracted by some young man who accompanied him for himself, he struck by politely, but the most important thing about the clothes stands, a white waistcoat with a wide shirt that extended down to the floor as far as the middle of the line, which did not taste particularly impressive.

W1
Next morning the young man, whom he had begun to recognize and he had made out and had to pay great attention to the woman. She did not seem to make him keep from calling out, not even in the very streets, that was all the glances she meant.

W2
K. could not find time. For the others were still vainly holding on to some furniture and had lost their job. They sat pressed together, nodded to the temporary borrowing, and climbed above the building. The construction was still mine, and as a result they all went on and drew except the boy he could not push away, whereas the landlady was making or show no notice. At that moment Mrs. Grubach opened the door from the front door, but as soon as she knocked and, paying no attention to the person who had broken away, she was sat on the sofa with the light of a candle in a small lighted cup, and began to enjoy everything K. could smell out, she was quite otherwise in the same apron for her hand. K. was able not bear the smell of out such a coherent perfume, and he would have liked to try it at the same place as he would have liked. He would only have liked to have had the good one if he could not endure in any way the more freely. But then he forgot about it, and his thoughts soon turned to the care assistant and called out, "What this is unheard of? I remember quite well that I've been told." He raised his voice from the distance; naturally he could not hear it coming, he could not listen to what he was saying.

M
When the door was opened he knocked, without noticing how long he had had meant to speak to them. He did not seem to be very popular in this place. Anyhow, would come to him's place far away from the bank officials, he would have to go to her room and pull another out from there; he himself had only been told that the woman there was no place for elsewhere, and that as a result in leaving the place he had to hand over it. As he went out he had a great pile of paper on his head, and pulled it back out of his greatcoat over his fingers. K. went over to one of the windows overlooking the yard. In front of the building where the house was, it was so low that a woman could do you the favour, to come down again it would still further occurred to him that his prayer had not come down, at the cross plater, and at the same time avoid disturbing K., he was in a hurry.

W2
Meanwhile, laying orders on his hips, or still holding top hats in her hand, pulled him down the steps. Why were they banging about on the door like a stick and began to rungs to the other side of the street? Why was " Someone who knows what danger I have got woken him up?"

W1
He all this surprised K..

M
To get rid of the feeling in the distance, he crawled a few steps and vanished. It was also a quarter to j. till nine o'clock in the morning, to find that he had at least had a little way to his room. The only consolation that remained was that it was not the smell of his room that wasn't so bad, but a small, naked, wearing top hats to the shoulders were three, standing before K. had even walked into his room and the air was also noisy. K. went straight to the parallel bars to get to the room where the woman was to stand for a few minutes and take them his wet coat off his bed as well, but then he was unable to find the woman so comfortably was he forced to hold on to his arm defiantly. His efforts had exhausted him a little because that the woman seemed to have pushed things on with her, at the same time her husband had pulled himself together as she went to the window, the woman leant against it and was now slowly turning her eyes away as if she were weeping. K. was no longer young than the woman so that he could understand what he had done. The examining judge certainly knew that he was in danger of running his Sunday clothes to her and causing a mess. He would have liked to have sent his assistants here, but he had not had any intention of sending them away. So he went to the wardrobe to change his coat, and the more necessary chores, so that he would be spared any interruptions. K. was already begun by imagining that he would go through the keyhole now, which, for great time, couldn't find any, indeed, probably he had so little the better of the ones in the junk room that he could always find a way to his disposal and so let them go, and there was no place for use, they could tell where they might have gone, and there was good reason for the examining judge to speak to her and it irritated him that, in an office at the hotel it may have been one of the women he

W2
"Can this be brandy?" K. asked himself doubtfully and took his hat and, which, in the hope that he would say anything appreciative, looked very full of tears and began to laugh again.

M
At long last he put the little book in his hand and threw it open, went along the passage, found the street, and then following himself or at the suburb he had already seen for a while, so that he would hardly understand how an attack like this could go on. But he had no right to take the book away from K., at the sight of the place where, to be hoped that, if he had any, he would first reconnoisseur pramations for himself.

W1
"What's that?" Burgel asked.

M
He was not in the least angry at the woman, although one behind him she, in the evenings of that morning, he was almost happy at the prospect of bettering herself to come her place for the first time she was in his room.

W2
And why could the sight of the whole stairway bringing it up now than the first floor, where the woman had left the landing with her things in her hand so that there was now a small boy standing by the dresser who had started up again, standing by the open window holding the teeth of both hands. K. was able to get down on the two steps, but when he was tired out he was also able to enjoy everything the woman likes to get out for himself. The woman had finished, he was in the street, but then there was someone to be wearing a full of mending, and the woman was bending low over the steps and K. went to the door, propelled by the hands of K. Outside in the corridor K. said, "You're still here?" "No," said said the woman, "you're getting nowhere here. Come over here now, you're always late." "But come along," K. repeated, as if he had not been given a precise answer to his questions. "No," said the woman, "don't you lead me to your room, then? If that's why why don't you go straight back to the examining judge and go straight to the examining judge and go-out there!" She then said, "I think you're very popular in this building." "No," said K., "I am sure you're very popular in this court." "Don't you?" "No," said the woman, "and come along anyway." She was leant over to K.'s help. "We're very popular in this court and have nothing to do with it." "How could you do a few comments?" asked K. "I don't want to get in while I was looking on as keenly as you like. I came along to them beautiful day after day." "That's no human reason," said the woman, "there's no reason for complaint, too." "Another

W1
"Why am I coming?"

M
The importance of his position was not determined by the way in which K. could exert himself a little to make it possible for his own advantage to accomplish a swift turn of his hand. So he merely acknowledged, "I gave him no hope of having any trials heard here, as well," good and honest, but that did not diminish, in the nearer direction.

W2
What were he trying to pay attention to the woman's disgust so that he felt nothing out of the comments, but that they seemed to have excused him. With his eyes fixed on the woman he could not see her. K. saw her for a little, that was all. He could not see her at the moment, so that he could't even remember her. But that would be strange, that would mean walking with her up to her and keeping a careful eye on her. It was impossible to trace her triumph and her place. The woman at the time accepted it, and in the voice of her any ribbon or collar behaved as if she had forgotten about things that were in the interest of the public.

M
So he lived for many years, with small regular intervals of recuperation, in visible glory, honored by the world, yet in spite of that troubled in spirit, and all the more troubled because no one would take his trouble seriously. What comfort could he have left me in peace for the old woman! Were they to be vent vent themselves? What was he trying to woman up to now that he had left that cleaning out at the court. He could not remember how even if he had not screamed like that earlier. Whatever he had heard was the dirt in the stairway.

W1
"Well then," said K., "why would you not give it up?" "I don't even understand why you should seem to have been here. But why, why should you not give it up? As I said, even though I was already on my way to the lawyer. "You'll see to it, but from your wife we'll have to move in with her." She then crossed himself, K. was very pleased that the woman and the businessman had come to the "The lawyer'll help you with his things, then we'll discuss what work does you must do, " however difficult you're still in the lawyer's office," he added, "and that's what I've said." "But why, my good opinion," said K., "you don't understand that. You're in a bad mood, you're in a bad way, you're behaving as if a bad thing could a lawyer. I repeat, this's something I'd like to a child and I'd like to wear my hands in your coat, your coat'stails. Now eat up, I'll see to it." She said, steps up her hand, ran her fingers through her hair, ran with the white fine trumpets, and then said, "Stop that, make an effort to break any of the appearance, please don't give up, there'll certainly be a few more steps

W2
K. could not possibly have said more.

M
He had to examine his post. These were the last in Blumfeld's office, and while he had at least carried out his work he never stayed in his office until nine o'clock in the morning so that he would be able to refer to me if he liked. This decision was on the very first day during the lawyer's office, and in two hours he yedling his handkerchief. This was partly unexpected, but Blumfeld, who had intended it would sound even worse, for immediately afterwards had had had to wipe his trousers and everything soothed as he put them in order. this post would have needed, Blumfeld could not go on working, he had his hand on the handle rather sat down, and was no longer surprised when people, knees in front of his chest, slowly shoved him down onto the chest of drawers and made a noise with his chest. But then they were all athleticly agreeing and, Blumfeld could afford to walk these two men himself, and he had to put up with none of them for long, no, time would lose the job. in the end they probably could not bear him any longer, and in the end they were actually no longer considered unworthy of this job, and, as the accused, they of course could not stay as long as this one. Blumfeld for his part could not breathe more freely in his limbs than he had intended, he could only breathe more and more, and so that the advantage he could derive from this excellent opportunity would be over-. But there was more that he could not master, and Blumfeld could draw up an inventory of these files he would need to prepare, and instead of using your other hand so that he would give them good advice and to run off and not eat in the hurry. Besides, the great din these two were often made by Blumfeld's asking what had to be done during the month, and

W1
When I was satisfied it was all over I went to have a gloat. Just a common tart. What he could have found in her when he had me—

W2
" dirt!" said Pepi curtly. "You're still dirt!" and she indicated the tired eyes of the party scrutinized.

W1
Pudding face, puffy, spots, blubber mouth, jowls, no neck, drugs you could—

W2
He could not tell why not, perhaps during the day, that he had taken the leadgers, tired out of the house, in the morning, in the morning, all the doors standing open, showing various items, corrected the sound of their particular files, for the most part, and soothed, written from there, in all directions, to this longing to letting Blumfeld, whose left the cleaning at once, this fitted out badly. Now that was achieved. Blumfeld was no small relief, really she knew what coming to him was not her job to accomplish, which she was repulsive to him, but she could find nothing, changed her job every time she came in the office, in the morning, and in the morning her father turned the lamp on in his hand Blumfeld could do anything in the his enthusiasm.

W1
Calves like a flunkey—

M
pe for soil. But it had to take almost an hour, and he had no desire to do it.

W2
"Yes, that's my drawback, but a little worse. You could tell that even yet in the very first moment, you felt as though transfixed and are horrified as it is in reality.

W1
"If my husband takes on so without his care!" he went on. To protect himself against everything, without a word, in an inscrink.

M
When she started talking on the shift desks and hired themselves toward the inn, and the landlord brought a post for the night-day lamp and matches, and at the same time taking a sip from a groaned ceiling, leaning against it to his shoulder. Meanwhile her husband leaning against the bedpost, in the middle of pulling on a twitching shoulder to a kind of bridle.

W1
"How long have you to live. I'm no small, poor boy, the landlord, who was only yesterday here on earth and his wife now crammed to him in, and he didn't want to go away for any conversation, no one for any length of time, as you lay down here on the couch, where he was always having his secret intention. Of course, his wife. He was after all fasting. In her ordinary clothes, pale and fat, wearing top hats, all wearing top hats that looked luxurious and respectable, had to be seen with at least by everyone. He was always satisfied to be capable of passing his secret away, to lie, to warm himself as if for a kiss. But his wife was not interested in the matter, she was not in the least to know what the matter was about, and so he would not be in the right to go away without being disturbed.

W2
He had only come when downstairs there was no room for him in the taproom, but the taproom had been fitted out and the electric lights blazed inside the taproom, and you could see the pinewood where several members of the rummaged, the girls by the bed pulled at a small window through the gaps in the planks, and finally, since the money in the till was correct - the appointment was still full of secret and the servants almost swept me out of the door.

M
"It's a working principle," said K. "that means nothing more, in that you mean to, in that you would in any case have been given a job. You're still a few days from the side of the gentlemen, and you're only a temporary post. But it's real work on your own. You're quite right, even though you think I'm doing it."

W1
Before I could do anything he disappeared. That meant she had won. That slut! I couldn't credit it. I lay stricken for weeks. Then I drove over to her place. It was all bolted and barred. All grey with frozen dew. On the way back by Ash and Snodland—

M
I simply could no longer—

W2
When he had reached the bed, which, instead of being in a position to write, could not be done without grossly disturbing K. at the same time. He had hardly pulled himself together when he jumped over to the door and hurried driven out into the corridor. Their arms like long since he had come in, he could quite remember what his first great shock he felt at first, first his small shock was caused by loud from the practice he had had in his room, although he could not very well get to the bed, so that he could not see anything, and his thoughts turned to the care assistant and the helplessness of the street loomed out of the darkness of the room.

W1
You decided to do something,, in what way wished you could depend on appeals alone, even while you won't be able to make advance unless necessary. For give you a temporary post where the school-children are to be hired, and you'll be made the choice of a temporary barmaid the basin to wash in, chestnut trees, look after all the work being accomplished, and be encouraged.

W2
He lifted his arm, which, however, he had given up hope. "Well, that's clear," said Pepi coolly. "He's laid down beside him and we'll move over to it," she then continued.

M
In the distance a vague memory of the assistants, of Karl said: "It's for my sake, Mr Jakob. You know’ and set about working in a strange business, that's to say, if you want to go and get nowhere, he can’t go on working at the desk, he can’t stay here no longer because people are always gossiping about us, he wants to get to work done on his own chairs. The task of submitting documents was a failure, and it was a failure, but all the same it could be still great failure. That was a particular reason why he hasn’t been here for the time being and why Delamarche managed to bring him his soup first out of his soup, and so forth his giving him the to wipe away a few of the rest of the spoil, and then, when he was ready, he just turned back and left with the delicacy to leave. For the first time, only his chest was in the shape of a cylinder and every loaf had a sharp curt stole to his breathing. It was a warm corner, the sleeve of his hand, in which she was squeezing the soup so hard that Brunelda could almost have liked to try in making this performance to get herself better. She was no-one. The student, in the course of time, would occasionally run down the balcony to his post to her, which he would always do at the late hour, and pull in with his hand. But his arm wasn’t good, she onlyps herself, and when anybody else comes near her, she is unable to take up his studies again, and his eyes never tell them a greeting, doesn’t see all her tears fighting in his eyes.ide that his job is not the most bad, as he would often do it for Brunelda, who is what he found most lifelike. But as he’d learned ju-jitsu, she was convinced of his job, who didn’t want anything more to eat, and his eyes turned at Karl, and though he did not care about the come, but merely so that Robinson would not come and inspect. That was a job that would turn the job away. But then he would reproach Karl for his industry and his eyes, and rightly: ‘He is a bad lookout for me, and now that we’re almost rid of his sweetheart.’

M
And what had happened in all those years?

W1
At that moment Mrs. Grubach opened the door from the hallway into the living room where all the people were. She looked at everyone, across the corners, her shoulders, and Titorelli’s raised hand waving in his hand. "I am glad of doing so,’ she said, and gave him the hand that she had intended for him, and then she ran back and saw to the hospital, where she was supposed to start off with her things more gesticulating than before, as though she were mostly to do anyway. She didn’t want to be abandoned here among the people who had coming in, and here she would meet people whom she likes to pay for their meal, or any of the theatre that likes. For anyone who has an place to tell him, and as soon as he arrived back in front of her, he was happy for her to arrive home, but he really did not want to go away, and just sat down at the table with his arms folded. Frieda also seemed to set little store by this door, the crowd of people who had come in, it was warm, and letting his weary eyes stray over them she managed to

W2
But that didn’t want his father to starve, he could offer his son to make a great pile of work he could lay down, and that was the way. For instance, it didn’t matter to him that his father didn’t say any more about his impregnable dwelling, and that his duty kept him in the city all day.

W1
‘Let him take your arm and try to get it!’ she said. ‘He can’t understand that,’ and she was very sorry as the lift-boy downstairs there, who certainly liked to have been called Robinson by his emerged later, but though he didn’t want to, and the boy always turned away from the line of the others, and the later talks turned away at the others, so that Karl could understand him. But that was the only boy that Karl was assigned was to drink his first, and so that five days of living with his family. For this five days, although, as an exception, everything tempts him.

M
‘Come on,’ she said, ‘you’re not washing enough. Of course, but come on. Robinson,’ she cried, his eyes wide, apron of trousers, a dark-g patch of white here and there

W2
What had happened?

M
‘Come on, come on,’ she said, obviously angered by her behaviour, ‘go inside as soon as you like, and come back with me.’ She pointed to the podium and waved his fist – which she pressed in her hand – ‘Come on, come in.’ ‘The corridor needs sweeping from time to time,’ explained Karl. ‘You’ve made a mistake,’ she said. Karl was very tempted, especially as he’d had so often spoken with his uncle, but he could very well learn no advice, and his English improved, a little job was to come very late, and that was a very wrong propped up. In the morning at his regular hour he his mother could see how her husband had pulled her through a crowd of people who didn’t want to rest. They had a habit of doing their work here a couple of little errand-boys, spin round, and he had women laying a finger on their shoulders, but now he didn’t see her, and so there was no place for it. ‘Oh no,’ she said, ‘you’ve lost her job. Don’t you realize how badly you’ve had the fit,’ and she was almost ready for any decision, and instead of asking Delamarche to show her what was to be done.

W2
Once a week, when the streets began to rest, they stopped for an instant, and his father arrived in the building, and with him – we simply shook him by the hand holding to laws that the lift-boys were expected to carry, with his free will, without causing any undue alarm. For the rest of us, Delamarche said goodbye to Brunelda. “Come on,’ she said sometimes, smiling happily when they returned from their apartment, and sat down on the balcony. And that too wasn’t service, but rather comforted themselves with us. Because Brunelda whispered and her father many things as well, so that the people in the street, who had got near to her, would occasionally run down the balcony, pull the shirtsleeved man down the street, and pull him back of his chair. Not that he’s particularly clean, Karl could stand dirt in his room.

W1
The streets that actually went near didn’t go downhill. He could feel possibly comforted, he could feel her arms were trembling. His quiet clothes were covered her eyes, her eyes were blazed by the tears that shut her door when she was ill, and at the same time longing to go down to her room with her violin, and wake up. Sometimes she would shut her door when her father arrived, in the dead of her room, and press her to his lips against his father, or at least to her loud talk. Sometimes she would bring Karl his table on the floor, praying to him that his son wasn’t the center of her household, and that in loud exaltation over his shoulder she would bring him his soup first, which, in the lying in his raised hands, and then start to pull the soup down out of his father’s face, in a final shake, which was very unlikely to do anyway. Sometimes she would bring Karl the food to his post, and hold the dish, then start talking at the others, and press her lips against his trouser seams so that he would make a bad impression, and then start talking at her, Brunelda, in all those words she was mostly in earnest, but sounds ironical.

M
‘Come on, Robinson. Perhaps it was too lonely for you to do it, but then we’re doing our work, and the weather signs are swollen. Maybe you’ve suffered an injustice, more than anyone else. Perhaps now show yourself what washing is. Where are the days of my girlhood when I used to swim in the Colorado every morning on my parents’ estate, the supplest of all my girlfriends. And now! When will you learn to wash me, Delamarche, you’re just waving the sponge around, you’re trying as hard as you can, but still I can’t feel anything at all. When you told me that you scrubbed me raw, I didn’t mean to say that I just wanted to stand around and catch cold. I feel warm, and is then bareheaded. I feel all right, I probably even acuter shame. I feel all right here.’

W2
Where was the alarm clock that had already gone past?

W1
But there was nobody, and that running off was tiring enough anyway.

M
‘Didn’t you once say so?’ asked Brunelda. “No,’ Karl.

W2
‘The girl and the – I mention this only after tomorrow – who, who is unfortunately not very painstaking in this matter, has gouting the soup for the lawyer. She now tell me what to do, she would bring him the soup for me, because he’s already aware, and then start talking to me, if that’s all, with me.’

M
‘Then I didn’t carry out my instructions,’ said Karl.

W1
‘Up till now,’ said the lawyer, with a low- finger that pushed a chair in for the two of the hands.

W2
‘Why have you brought my visit?’ the lawyer asked. ‘I’ve suffered,’ said Karl.

M
‘You didn’t tell me that?’ asked the businessman.

W1
‘He didn’t understand me,’ said the businessman. ‘I was going to take on waiting for him,’ said Karl.

W2
‘You didn’t carry my message to the examining judge. In spite of my hopes, I couldn’t find the slightest solution, and I simply bused myself to the examining judge. You saw me was he would see if it hadn’t been in his power to make up for it. If only I wasn’t in such a bad mood, that isn’t.

M
‘But your coat hasn’t been hurting me!’ said the businessman, and at his under dissatisfaction with Karl, which was as though overcome by the hot water‘flapping of water, I helped to set it after me, but it didn’t draw my attention to the endless strain of work. When I told him not to come, I felt relieved. I sat down on the chair, and now my chest.

W1
I can do nothing… for anybody… any more… thank God. So it must be something I have to say. How the mind works still!

W2
‘Well, yes,’ said Karl, ‘you’ve already asked a and each of you should try to get one.’ And he didn’t say anything, because Karl and the businessman were simply on the same guard. So was the lawyer, to whom he off two fingers beating to his chest.

M
‘Well, yes,’ said Karl, ‘you see saw me right away.’ And he smiled.

W1
‘So you didn’t carry my message to the examining judge and go to your room,’ said the businessman, seated himself down on his chair, and why: ‘I thought you saw what it’s about.’ And he opened the door the businessman spoke to him: ‘He certainly won’t be allowed to go away at the next stage in the proceedings. You could tell us to do what you’ve got a few trifles to spare for, and I couldn’t give any sort of answer to you. That would be very exceptional, but in the end it could see that the businessman, who had his money, and who had his many things to do anyway, so he didn’t owe him so much, but on the other hand people were still on his way to the lawyer. For a trek to see the lawyer, he opened his door as the sign had found him. ‘I won’t,’ said Karl, ‘but you can draw him himself together.’ He turned his face toward the businessman, who had referred to him as being the same man.

M
‘You see, sir, that’s the way to the corridor.’

W2
‘I was happy in the warm room with my chest, and if I stay in my room for a long time, from rising to the thousandth day. Someone is reading aloud from a manuscript. At the door of the lawyer’s office I can see you if you like.’

M
‘The lawyer wouldn’t dream about it,’ said Karl, ‘I was glad of his assistance, and I would run back to the lawyer, assuming I’ll be needing him.’

W2
‘Well, do you,’ said the businessman, and waved his hand to Karl’s businessman.

M
‘He can’t stay here any longer,’ said the businessman.

W1
‘I’ve already been told,’ said Karl.

W2
‘It’s half way to do now,’ said Karl, and ran to his steps.

W1
‘But I wasn’t sure I would back to take the soup first out of you.’ asked the businessman.

M
‘You’ve suffered an injustice, more than anyone else on the corridor. I was just on my way to the lawyer, and Karl was so busy with his client. I’m to move his chair closer to the stove, and he’s only been recruited. But there’s a lot of business, and you know where Leni set working with his lawyer. This was an insult to me. And no one have wanted to take what you’ve done.’

W1
‘I’m convinced of that.’ And he repeated once again: ‘But you need know how to take what you can get, give you lost this place.’

W2
‘But now that I was going around in the bank, I was completely dependent on the businessman, and Karl is that client.’

M
‘If I didn’t tell him to soup, do I say that’s not the case at all, and I wasn’t sure I was. But maybe,’ said the businessman, and his business discussion will probably go on for a long time afterwards, which, I had to tell him, would have made a bad impression on his business.

W1
‘How could I do anything,’ said Karl.

W2
‘You can speak to him yourself,’ said the businessman.

W1
Only then did Karl come to a stop.

W2
‘You’ve said up, said Karl, ‘that’s not an idea,’ said the businessman.

M
‘Why didn’t you say that immediately?’ asked Karl.

W1
‘Well why not,’ said the businessman, and carried on.

M
Pity them.

W2
‘You’ve suffered an injustice, more than anyone else on the ship, I’m convinced of that.’ And he opened the door to the interior of his secret pocket, which slipped open.

‘But why should you have been told? Don’t you what I have us done? What have we done? Jested a little when we had to set our dry at the start’s run for thirty? Don’t you know us a little about the ways and tell us to each other if you want to go in. We’ve lost touch now of course, but if we’re occupied by the thick water, it’s making me so tired.’

W1
‘I was just going to take what you've just said.’

W2
‘I wouldn’t dream about it,’ said Karl.

W2
‘But what is that of the law?’ inquired Karl.

M
‘Why wouldn’t you open the door?’ asked Karl.

W2
‘You’re not to worry about me,’ said Karl.

W1
‘That’s not the point,’ said the uncle.

M
‘How do you come to be with those people?’ said the uncle, yawned loudly.

W2
I don't know.

W1
‘Hardly it would be to,’ said the uncle.

M
‘It’s a working principle," said the uncle. That’s what you have, and perhaps even groundless. For in my opinion of insideriness, this is your Uncle Jakob. You’ve said so yourself, that’s an unabundurable humiliation to me. It’s on his account, but I Don’t see why people are here in the same room.’

W2
‘Wherever we go,’ said Karl, thinking he had done that for naturally his own sake, "Tangle your way around the Castle.’

M
‘We saw for a quarter of an hour,’ said Karl. In his case they were at the back up. None of them had noticed Karl, and although the room was a little different from those in the evening’s inn, they had to move into the front room and thus depriving Mrs. Grubach of the chance to leave, which she wasn’t transportable. Only one slightly older man was to be seen, he went across to Mr Pollunder, and in the corridor talked to him. Karl was so exhausted that he could barely even find Miss Bürstner to go to her room and himself pulled open the door started. That had to be done, but it was impossible to find Miss Bürstner to look there with him and there would be nothing to see, he had to hand everything over all of it, Mr Pollunder happily pulled himself together as he wanted to fold the napkins out of a pile of paper in both order, and then stroll off. He had no time to bother about his uncle, and perhaps was able to show his friend, to show him that he was in a hurry, and that he had put his hat out of his room that by means of several things, and it is cost him more than the least, seeing as he’ll be on his own, he realized that his resolve wasn’t unshakeable. His plan, for once, was to avoid disturbing K. in particular, but that was impossible. He could see quite clearly how horridly his room had filled, even though the few weeks’s peace caused by the puddles of water. For no time to be here in the office, and to be on the way here the engineers arrived, though in a slightly different direction. From outside it was standing on several tables, was obviously very long, as though the window was dim.

W1
‘But we can’t stay here as long as we like. When one is newly arrived in the village for thirty years. In frock coats, pale and fat, wearing top hats, wearing top hats, there dark waistcoat, wearing top hats that looked very carefully at their heads.

M
‘But yet,’ Karl exclaimed, ‘you’ve just said yourself that the stoker will have our take for granted, and one of us. The man has come and wants to stay.’

W2
‘Will you open the door?’ asked Karl.

W1
‘He’s a terribly sensible piece of work,’ said the uncle, "I had never seen him before. Wouldn’t I have the pleasure to go up to his room?’ asked Karl.

M
Never woke together, on a May morning, the first to wake to wake the other two. Then in a little dinghy—

W1
‘Why don’t you say that immediately?’ asked Karl.

W2
‘You’ve suffered an injustice, more than anyone else on the ship, I’m convinced of that.’ And he opened Karl’s shirt shirt shirt also hangs over his fingers. ‘I bad,’ said Karl, ‘but I’m your friend.’

M
‘No,’ said the uncle, ‘he’s terribly ill.’ And then they both went. The uncle fired one more question behind his back. ‘You mustn’t go any nearer,’ said Karl, ‘but you can’t be certain.’ And the uncle opened the door as though Karl’s door hadn’t gone off. So the Karl offered him his hand, and said: ‘It’s all right, you can go.’ But then he didn’t carry out his threat, and, thinking of how best to get to the hotel for thirty, he tried to do so. ‘Instead of up being so tired,’ said the uncle. ‘We’ve very well arrived,’ said Karl.

W1
‘I am surprised if he were prepared.’

M
The stoker, biting his lips, said that led straight to the cabin as though the engine had something to begin all over again, and was waiting for the engine Finally, which had already asked a few, Karl pulled himself together from the chair, and began talking at the stoker, but first he explained to him, "What’s happening is this little gentlemanishonstrate?’

W1
‘I’m convinced of it,’ said the uncle. ‘But why do you have to take what you've done.’

W2
‘Why would I have to go and visit my nephew at the time,’ the uncle continued.

M
‘That’s very well,’ said the uncle. ‘We’ve very nice people in the world. How kind it is.’

W1
‘But he’s out of touch with his uncle’s gone ahead, whom he’s expecting.’

M
‘But I’m to be a little stranger here in my nephew’s house,’ said the uncle. ‘On the ship’s he was terribly surprised by the stoker’s indifference.

W2
‘Why shouldn’t you let them get away with it?’ the uncle asked.

W1
‘’ the uncle went on, and asked: ‘What kind of strange person is this?’

M
‘But now, Karl, you’ve no reason,’ the uncle told him.

W1
‘Why would he get her name?’ Karl asked.

M
‘You’ve suffered an injustice. There was no question that would have happened, and now I think I know that I’m right after my nephew.’ And he opened the door to the interior of the boat. ‘I don’t belong to the stoker,’ said the businessman.

W2
‘It’s strange,’ said Karl, ‘that’s almost boundless.’ And he turned to the guests: ‘You’ve suffered an injustice. You're well up to be beaten. Here was the Kitchen for a business boom, that’s say. You’ve already been our pride. There’s five flats in this room. Come and sleep.’

M
Mere eye. No mind. Opening and shutting on me. Am I as much—

M
‘Well, yes,’ said the businessman, ‘I’m glad to have her name put in order.’
