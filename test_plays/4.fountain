W1
Yes perhaps a shade gone I suppose some might say

W2
Yes perhaps a shade gone I suppose some might say

M
We were not long together—

W1
I said to him, Give her up. I swore by all I held most sacred—

W2
Yes peace one assumed all out all the pain

M
Yes peace one assumed all out all the pain

W2
What are you talking about? I said, stitching away. Someone yours? Give up whom? I smell you off him, she screamed, he stinks of bitch.

W1
Though I had him dogged for months by a first-rate man, no shadow of proof was forthcoming. And there was no denying that he continued as… assiduous as ever. This, and his horror of the merely Platonic thing, made me sometimes wonder if I were not accusing him unjustly. Yes.

M
What have you to complain of… I said. Have I been neglecting you? How could we be together in the way we are if there were someone else? Loving her as I did, with all my heart, I could not but feel sorry for her.

W2
Fearing she was about to offer me violence I rang for Erskine and had her shown out. Her parting words, as he could testify, if he is still living, and has not forgotten, coming and going on the earth, letting people in, showing people out, were to the effect that she would settle my hash. I confess this did alarm me a little, at the time.

M
She was not convinced. I might have known. I smell her off you, she kept saying. There was no answer to this. So I took her in my arms and swore I could not live without her. I meant it, what is more. Yes, I am sure I did. She did not repulse me.

W1
Though I had not sure.

M
What have you to complain of? I said. Have I been neglecting you? How could we be together in the way we are if there were someone else? Loving her as I did, with all my heart, I could not but feel sorry for her.

W2
Why don't you get out, I said, when he started moaning about his home life, there is obviously nothing between you any more. Or is there?

W1
I confess my first feeling was one of wonderment. What a male!

M
(Pause)

W2
Anything between us, he said, what do you take me for, a something machine? And of course with him no danger of the… spiritual thing. Then why don't you get out? I said. I sometimes wondered if he was not living with her for her money.

M
The next thing was the scene between them. I can't have her crashing in here, she said, threatening to take my life. I must have looked incredulous. Ask Erskine, she said, if you don't believe me. But she threatens to take her own, I said. Not yours? she said. No, I said, hers. We had fun trying to work this out.

W1
Then I forgave him. To what will love not stoop! I suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or our darling Grand Canary. He was looking pale. Peaked. But this was not possible just then. Professional commitments.

W2
Anything between us, he said, hers. We had fun trying to work this out.

M
Then I got frightened and made a clean breast of it. She was looking more and more desperate. She had a razor in her vanity-bag. Adulterers, take warning, never admit.

W1
The next thing they’re away together.

W2
When he came again we had it out. I felt like death. He went on about why he had to tell her. Too risky and so on. That meant he had gone back to her. Back to that!

W1
Pudding face, puffy, spots, blubber mouth, jowls, no neck, drugs you could—

W2
Then I forgave him. To what will love not stoop! I suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or our darling Grand Canary. He was looking pale. Peaked. But this was not possible just then. Professional commitments.

W1
When I was satisfied it was all over I went about has a gloat. Just a common tart. What he could have found in her when he had me–

M
When I saw her again she knew. She was looking—
(Hiccup)
—wretched. Pardon. Some fool was cutting grass. A little rush, then another. The problem was how to convince her that no… revival of intimacy was involved. I couldn't. I might have known. So I took her in my arms and said I could not go on living without her. I don't believe I could have.

W2
The only solution was to go away together. He swore we should as soon as he had put his affairs in order. In the meantime we were to carry on as before. By that he meant as best we could.

W1
So he was mine again. All mine. I was happy again. I went about singing. The world—

M
At home all heart to heart, new leaf and bygones bygones. I ran into your ex- doxy, she said one night, on the pillow, you're well out of that. Rather uncalled for, I thought. I am indeed, sweetheart, I said, I am indeed. God what vermin women. Thanks to you, angel, I said.

W1
Then I began to smell her off him again. Yes.

W2
When he stopped coming I was prepared. More or less.

M
So he was mine again. All mine. I was happy again. I went about singing. The world–

W1
Before I could do anything he disappeared. That meant she had won. That slut! I couldn't credit it. I lay stricken for weeks. Then I drove over to her place. It was all bolted and barred. All grey with frozen dew. On the way back by Ash and Snodland—

M
I simply could no longer—

W2
When he could no longer–

W1
Finally it could all have been all over I could.

W2
To say I am—

M
When first this change—

M
He made me nervous.

W1
Before I could go about why he could have put them down. I meant it, what is more fun?

W2
To say I am not disappointed, no, I am. I had anticipated something better. More restful.

W1
Or you will weary of me.

M
 I felt like death. He moved us. I went about why he had to give her a good hinnies.

W2
t was deep, deep. And you could see down to the bottom. So white. So clean.

M
To try and stand still the face, the pull is waiting, I confess, it is.

W2
When you go out—and I go out. Some day you will tire of me and go out… for good.

W1
You could not have waited?

M
Don’t tell me, Mrs Rooney, don’t tell me! Don’t believe me, Mrs Rooney, you’ll tell her I happened to look at me, I’ll never walk again unless we’ll carry you no good-feeling. I rang for Erskine.

W2
Let me tell it again. An Englishman, needing a pair of striped trousers in a hurry for the New Year festivities, goes to his tailor who takes his measurements. ‘That’s the lot, Mrs Rooney, I’ll be more kind of your ease-rel on. I know you may be right.

W1
Your arms?

M
Hellish half-light.

W2
No no, he died, you remember. No connexion.

M
Then let’s have a look.

W1
Is it that I do not tell the truth, is that it, that some day somehow I may tell the truth at last and then no more light at last, for the truth?

W2
Yes.

M
I know now, all that was just… play. And all this? When will all this—

W1
Is that it?

W2
Mightn't you?

M
All this, when will all this have been… just play?

W1
What?

W2
But I doubt it. It would not be like you somehow. And you must know I am doing my best. Or don't you?

M
Mightn’t you?

W1
But I have said all I can. All you let me. All I—

M
I can do nothing … for anybody … any more … thank God. So it must be something I have to say. How the mind works still!

W2
No doubt I make the same mistake as when it was the sun that shone, of looking for sense where possibly there is none.

M
Perhaps they have become friends. Perhaps sorrow–

W2
You took me for Godot.

M
Not even a squeeze of—

W1
But I doubt it. It would not be like you somehow. And you must know I am doing my best. Or don’t it?

W2
Am I taboo, I wonder. Not necessarily, now that all danger is averted. That poor creature—I can hear her—that poor creature—

W1
Bite off my tongue and swallow it? Spit it out? Would that placate you? How the mind works still to be sure!

M
Meet, and sit, now in the one dear place, now in the other, and sorrow together, and compare—
(Hiccup)
 pardon— happy memories.

W1
If only I could think. There is no sense in this… either, none whatsoever. I can't.

W2
Perhaps they have become friends. Perhaps sorrow–

M
Personally I always preferred Lipton's.

W1
Meet, and sit, now in the other, and sorrow together, and compare– pardon–

W2
They might even feel sorry for me, if they could see me. But never so sorry as I for them.

W1
I can't

W2
Kissing their sour kisses.

M
I pity them in any case, yes, compare my lot with theirs, however blessed, and—

W1
I can't. The mind won't have it. It would have to go. Yes.

M
I can’t.

W2
Kissing their sour kisses.

M
I can’t. The mind won’t have it. It would have to go. Yes.

W1
What do you do when you open them again?

W2
Like dragging a great roller, on a scorching day. The strain… to get it moving, momentum coming—

W2
Any longer.

M
Have I lost… the thing you want? Why go out? Why go—

W2
Pity them.

W1
Do you hear me screaming for you.

M
Why go down? Why not—

W2
I don't know.

W1
Perhaps she is sitting somewhere, by the open window, her hands folded in her lap, gazing down out over the olives—

M
What is it? Who is this thing, Dan?

W2
She was saying?

M
—don

W1
Try and walk.

M
Why not keep away from me then? Why not keep away from me with her feet, Henry?

W2
Perhaps it is not mine at all.

W1
Poor creature. Poor creatures.

M
Sucked up?

W1
Guess who taught me all these beautiful things. My Lucky?

W2
I say, Am I not perhaps a little unhinged already? Just a little? I doubt it.

M
A little dinghy—

W1
Silence and darkness were all I craved. Well, I get a certain amount of both. They being one. Perhaps it is more wickedness to pray for more.

M
Yes love, up into the blue, like gossamer. No? You don’t? Ah well, natural laws, natural laws, I suppose it’s like everything else, it all depends on the creature you happen to be. All I can say is for my part is that for me they are not what they were when I was young and … foolish and … … beautiful … possibly … lovely … in a way … to look at. Forgive me, this way, day, all day, all over, all day. No? You don’t believe in it, you tell me. The dark Miss Fitt, I don’t know, ah she made me sleep on. Ah I thought you were taking me for a happy day, by the end of the day and look at the lambs!’ Ada too, conversation with her, that was something, that’s what hell will tell me, I’ll tell her I was praying. Roaring prayers at God and his saints.

W1
Will it not soon be the age?

W2
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting to hear how drab she was going to live. That day. What day? I used to have her harp. Years of our idyll as we sat watching the ducks. Holding hands exchanging vows. We lay there without moving. But under us all moved, and moved us, gently, up and down. Not a sound. All day, all night and the day not over. Not a sound.

M
A little dinghy, on the river, let us go, gently, up and down, like moonbeam, but stay a eye on that too. Don’t look at one’ll see how it is. Good, she’s said, at last, it’s worse, what do they take us for, from there? Why are you always coming down here? There’s something dripping in my head. A bit of grit in the dark or moonlight, they’re together, TOGETHER it with it. I could have her crashing in here, she said, threatening to take my life. I must have looked incredulous. Ask Erskine, she said, if you don’t believe me. But she threatens to take her own, I said. Not yours? she said. No, I said, hers. We had fun trying to work this out.

W1
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting on my oars, they lolling on air-pillows in the stern … sheets. Drifting. Such fantasies.

M
Such fantasies. Then. And now—

W2
Day? What’s the great year my Lord?

W1
Now. What place are you all this time?

M
Then I forgave it up together. I forgave him. To what will love not stoop! I suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or our darling Grand Canary. He was looking pale. Peaked. But this was not possible just then. Professional commitments.

W1
Hellish half-light.

M
Looking for something. In my face. Some truth. In my eyes. Not even.

W2
(Laugh)

M
Mere eye. No mind. Opening and shutting on me. Am I as much—

M
She came again. Just strolled in. All honey. Licking her lips. Poor thing. I was doing my nails, by the open window. He has told me all about it, she said. Who he, I said filing away, and what it? I know what torture you must be going through, she said, and I have dropped in to say I bear you no ill-feeling. I rang for Erskine.
