W1
I said to him, Give her up— 

W2
One Morning as I was sitting— 

M
It was all over I went about singing.

W1
I said to him, Give her up. I swore by all I held most sacred—

W2
One morning as I was sitting stitching by the open window she burst in and flew at me. Give me up, she screamed, he's mine. Her photographs were kind to her. Seeing her now for the first time full length in the flesh I understood why he preferred me.

M
We were not long together when she smelled the rat. Give up that whore, she said, or I'll cut my throat—
(Hiccup)
pardon—so help me God. I knew she could have no proof. So I told her I did not know what she was talking about.

W2
What are you talking about? I said, stitching away. Someone yours? Give up whom? I smell you off him, she screamed, he stinks of bitch.

W1
Though I had him dogged for months by a first-rate man, no shadow of proof was forthcoming. And there was no denying that he continued as… assiduous as ever. This, and his horror of the merely Platonic thing, made me sometimes wonder if I were not accusing him unjustly. Yes.

M
What have you to complain of… I said. Have I been neglecting you? How could we be together in the way we are if there were someone else? Loving her as I did, with all my heart, I could not but feel sorry for her.

W2
We were not longer together, she said.

M
What are you talking about? I said, stitching away. Someone yours? Give up whom? I smell you off him, she screamed again.

W1
Judge then of my astonishment when one fine morning, as I was sitting stricken in the morning room, he slunk in, fell on his knees before me, buried his face in my lap and… confessed.

M
What have you to complain of? I said. Have I been neglect you? How could we be together in the way we are if there were someone else? Loving her as I did, with all my heart, I could not but feel sorry for her.

W2
Why don't you get out, I said, when he started moaning about his home life, there is obviously nothing between you any more. Or is there?

W1
I confess my first feeling was one of wonderment. What a male!

M
Though I had him dogged for months by a first-rate man, no on horse.

W2
Anything between us, he said, what do you take me for, a something machine? And of course with him no danger of the… spiritual thing. Then why don't you get out? I said. I sometimes wondered if he was not living with her for her money.

M
The next thing was the scene between them. I can't have her crashing in here, she said, threatening to take my life. I must have looked incredulous. Ask Erskine, she said, if you don't believe me. But she threatens to take her own, I said. Not yours? she said. No, I said, hers. We had fun trying to work this out.

W1
Then I forgave him. To what will love not stoop! I suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or our darling Grand Canary. He was looking pale. Peaked. But this was not possible just then. Professional commitments.

W2
Anything between us, she said, hers. We had fun trying to work this out.

M
Then I got frightened and made a clean breast of it. She was looking more and more desperate. She had a razor in her vanity-bag. Adulterers, take warning, never admit.

W1
The next thing was the scene between them. I can’t have her crashing in here, she said, threatening to take my life. I must have looked incredulous. Ask Erskine, she said, if you don’t believe me. But she threatens to take her own, I said. Not yours? she said. No, I said. We had fun trying to work this out.

W2
When he came again we had it out. I felt like death. He went on about why he had to tell her. Too risky and so on. That meant he had gone back to her. Back to that!

W1
Pudding face, puffy, spots, blubber mouth, jowls, no neck, drugs you could—

W2
Then I forgave him. To what will love not stoop! I suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or our darling Grand Canary. He was looking pale. Peaked. But this was not possible just then. Professional commitments.

W1
When I was satisfied it was all over I went about my bellyful of the world.

M
When I saw her again she knew. She was looking—
(Hiccup)
—wretched. Pardon. Some fool was cutting grass. A little rush, then another. The problem was how to convince her that no… revival of intimacy was involved. I couldn't. I might have known. So I took her in my arms and said I could not go on living without her. I don't believe I could have.

W2
Pudding face, puffy, spots, blubber mouth, jowls, no neck, dugs you could–

W1
So he was mine again. All mine. I was happy again. I went about singing. The world—

M
At home all heart to heart, new leaf and bygones bygones. I ran into your ex- doxy, she said one night, on the pillow, you're well out of that. Rather uncalled for, I thought. I am indeed, sweetheart, I said, I am indeed. God what vermin women. Thanks to you, angel, I said.

W1
Then I began to smell her off him again. Yes.

W2
When he stopped coming I was prepared. More or less.

M
He went on and on. I could hear a mower – pardon. I could have sworn I heard a mower –

W1
At home all heart to heart, new leaf and bygones. I ran into your ex-doxy, she said one night, on the pillow, you’re well out of that and me. Rather uncalled for, I thought. I am indeed, sweetheart, I said, I am indeed. God what vermin women. Thanks to you, angel, I said.

M
Then I began to smell her off him again. Yes.

W2
When he could have it was all too much. I simply could no longer–

W1
Mercy, mercy—

W2
The essential change….

M
When first this change—

M
When first this change I actually thanked God. I thought, It is done, it is said, now all is going out—

W1
Mercy, mercy, tongue still hanging out for mercy. It will come. You haven't seen me. But you will. Then it will come.

W2
In the tower.

W1
Or you will weary of me.

M
At nightfall. Mother. One hasn’t changed a hair, just the same old wag he always was. Getting on for seventy-five is it?

W2
Mercy, mercy, tongue in the cup.

M
I thought.

W2
When you go out—and I go out. Some day you will tire of me and go out… for good.

W1
Down, Mother, under the lambs!

M
Peace, yes, I suppose, a kind of peace, and all that pain as if… never been.

W2
Give me up, as a bad job. Go away and start poking and pecking at someone else. On the other hand—

W1
Get off me! Get off me!

M
It will come. Must come. There is no future in this.

W2
Give me your hand. There, don’t be afraid, Miss!

M
Ah! Don’t be there you are again till it does, by always, and so changed from what I happen to imagine?

W1
What is it, Mrs Rooney, I don’t be long now, just like our own poor dear Gaelic, there is that to be unpleasant.

W2
You might get angry and blaze me clean out of my wits. Mightn't you?

M
I know now, all that was just… play. And all this? When will all this—

W1
Good God!

W2
Mightn't you?

M
All this, when will all this have been… just play?

W1
Pray out of me to driving I would, as I have been in bed, Mr Slocum, I have little doubt your Maker would requite you, if no one else.

W2
But I doubt it. It would not be like you somehow. And you must know I am doing my best. Or don't you?

M
Perhaps they have become friends. Perhaps sorrow—

W1
But I have said all I can. All you let me. All I—

M
I can do nothing … for anybody … any more … thank God. So it must be something I have to say. How the mind works still!

W2
No doubt I make the same mistake as when it was the sun that shone, of looking for sense where possibly there is none.

M
Perhaps they have become friends. Perhaps sorrow–

W2
But I cannot, no question of mine.

M
Not even a squeeze of—

W1
But I doubt it. It would not be like you somehow. And you must know I am doing my best. Or don’t you?

W2
Perhaps they meet, and sit, over a cup of that green tea they both so loved, without milk or sugar not even a squeeze of lemon–

W1
Bite off my tongue and swallow it? Spit it out? Would that placate you? How the mind works still to be sure!

M
A poor creature who tried to seduce you, what ever became of her, do you suppose?–I can hear her. Poor thing.

W1
If only I could think. There is no sense in this… either, none whatsoever. I can't.

W2
Perhaps they have become friends. Perhaps sorrow–

M
Are you listening to me? Is anyone looking at me? Is anyone bothering about me at all?

W1
And that all is falling, all fallen, from the beginning, on empty air. Nothing being asked at all. No one asking me for anything at all.

W2
They might even feel sorry for me, if they could see me. But never so sorry as I for them.

W1
I can't

W2
But I have said all I can. All your let me. All I-

M
I pity them in any case, yes, compare my lot with theirs, however blessed, and—

W1
I can't. The mind won't have it. It would have to go. Yes.

M
Pity them.

W2
What do you do when you go out? Shift?

M
Am I hiding something? Have I lost—

W1
What do you do when you go out? Do you want me to bed?

W2
Pity them must have put them in order.

W2
What?

M
The same as I hope you have been drifting on and off with Bianca in the gobber, or inverse, case one can little heart out of the four Evangelists, no, how are you going to live without cellars I ask you, on piles if you don’t mind, piles, like in the lake age, there’s progress for you.

W2
She said. I can’t go and see has she back.

W1
Perhaps she has taken him away to live… somewhere in the sun.

M
Why go down? Why not—

W2
Ah there I’m with you the curse of society look at what it leads up to, when you think my niece had a little girl as good as never knew her father.

W1
Perhaps she is sitting somewhere, by the open window, her hands folded in her lap, gazing down out over the olives—

M
Why not keep on glaring at me without ceasing? I might start to rave and—
(Hiccup)
—bring it up for you. Par—

W2
No.

M
I don’t know.

W1
Gazing down out over the olives, then the sea, wondering what can be keeping him, growing cold. Shadow stealing over everything. Creeping. Yes.

M
Why not keep on glaring at me without ceasing? I might start to rave and––bring up for you. Par–

W2
Am I not perhaps a little unhinged already?

W1
Poor creature. Poor creatures.

M
Never woke together, on a May morning, the first to wake to wake the other two. Then in a little dinghy—

W1
Penitence, yes, at a pinch, atonement, one was resigned, but no, that does not seem to be the point either.

W2
I say, Am I not perhaps a little unhinged already? Just a little? I doubt it.

M
A little dinghy—

W1
Silence and darkness were all I craved. Well, I get a certain amount of both. They being one. Perhaps it is more wickedness to pray for more.

M
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting on my oars, they lolling on air-pillows in the stern… sheets. Drifting. Such fantasies.

W1
Hellish half-light.

W2
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting my oars, they lolling on air-pillows in the stern … sheets. Drifting. Such fantasies.

M
We were not civilized.

W1
Dying for dark—and the darker the worse. Strange.

M
Such fantasies. Then. And now—

W2
A shade gone. In the head. Just a shade. I doubt it.

W1
Yes, and the whole thing there, all there, staring you in the face. You will see it. Get off me. Or weary.

M
Dying for dark–and the darker the worse. Strange.

W1
Such fantasies. Then. And now–

M
Looking for something. In my face. Some truth. In my eyes. Not even.

W2
(Laugh)

M
And now, that you are … mere eye. Just looking. At my eyes. Not even.

M
Such fantasies. Then. And now? And now, that you are … mere eye. Just looking. At my eyes she had been. Everything there, as usual, and could seek out a shady place beneath. The bag. Could I? No. The earth might be uninhabited.
