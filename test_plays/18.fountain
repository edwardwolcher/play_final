W1
Yes perhaps a shade gone I too far.

W2
Yes perhaps a shade gone I suppose some might say

M
We were not long together—

W1
I said to him, Give her up. I swore by all I held most sacred—

W2
Yes peace one assumed all out all the pain

M
Yes peace I could not

W2
Yes peace one assumed all out all the pain

W1
Yes perhaps a little jaunt to hear only every now.

M
Ripped open and did not know what he disappeared after me. Those days by love so much the same inanities.

W2
Fearing she was about to offer me violence I rang for Erskine and had her shown out. Her parting words, as he could testify, if he is still living, and has not forgotten, coming and going on the earth, letting people in, showing people out, were to the effect that she would settle my hash. I confess this did alarm me a little, at the time.

M
no getting out till the time came

W1
no thing out before its festivities, you know what it is, you may be wrong.

M
She was not convinced. I might have known. What happened was this, I put them on and then I took them off again and then I put them on again and then I took them on again and then I took them off again and then I took them on again and then I took them on again and then I took them on again and then I no –

W2
Poor Maddy!

W1
She was not convinced. I might have known. I smell her off you, she kept saying. There was no answer to this. So I took her in my arms and swore I could not live without her. I meant it, what is more. Yes, I am sure I did. She did not repulse me.

M
the Library that was another place another time that time you slipped in off the street out of the cold and rain slipped in when no one was looking what was it then you were never the same after never again after something to do with dust something the dust said sitting at the big round table with a bevy of old ones poring on the page and not a sound

W2
Anything between us, he said, what do you take me for, a something machine? And of course with him no danger of the… spiritual thing. Then why don't you get out? I said. I sometimes wondered if he was not living with her for her money.

M
The next thing was the scene between them. I can't have her crashing in here, she said, threatening to take my life. I must have looked incredulous. Ask Erskine, she said, if you don't believe me. But she threatens to take her own, I said. Not yours? she said. No, I said, hers. We had fun trying to work this out.

W1
Then I forgave him. To what will love not stoop! I suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or our darling Grand Canary. He was looking pale. Peaked. But this was not possible just then. Professional commitments.

W2
Judge then of my astonishment when one fine morning, as I was sitting stricken in the morning room, he slunk in, fell on his knees before me, buried his face in my lap and … confessed.

M
that time in the end when you tried and couldn’t by the window in the dark and the owl flown to hoot at someone else or back with a shrew to its hollow tree and not another sound hour after hour hour after hour hour after hour not a sound when you tried and tried and couldn’t any more no words left to keep it out so gave it up gave up there by the window in the dark or moonlight gave up for good and let it in and nothing the worse a great shroud billowing in all over you on top of you and little or nothing the worse little or nothing

W1
The next thing was the scene between them. I can’t have her crashing in here, she said, threatening to take my life. I must have looked incredulous. Ask Erskine, she said, if you don’t believe me. But she threatens to take her own, I said. We had fun trying to work this out.

W2
When he came again we had it out. I felt like death. He went on about why he had to tell her. Too risky and so on. That meant he had gone back to her. Back to that!

W1
Pudding face, puffy, spots, blubber mouth, jowls, no neck, drugs you could—

W2
She put a bloodhound on me, but I had a little chat with him. He was glad of the extra money.

W1
Calves like a flunkey—

M
When I saw her again she knew. She was looking—
(Hiccup)
—wretched. Pardon. Some fool was cutting grass. A little rush, then another. The problem was how to convince her that no… revival of intimacy was involved. I couldn't. I might have known. So I took her in my arms and said I could not go on living without her. I don't believe I could have.

W2
The only solution was to go away together. He swore we should as soon as he had put his affairs in order. In the meantime we were to carry on as before. By that he meant as best we could.

W1
So he was mine again. All mine. I was happy again. I went about singing. The world—

M
Why don’t you get out, I said, when he started moaning about his home life, there is obviously nothing between you any more. Or is there?

W1
Then I began to smell her off him again. Yes.

W2
The only solution was to go away together. He swore we should as soon as he had put his affairs in order. In the meantime we were to carry on as before. By that he meant as best we could.

M
Finally it was all too much. I simply could no longer—

W1
At home all heart to heart, new leaf and bygones bygones. I ran into your ex-doxy, she said one night, on the pillow, you’re well out of that. Rather uncalled for, I thought. I am indeed, sweetheart, I said, I am indeed. God what vermin women. Thanks to you, angel, I said.

M
I simply could no longer—

W2
I made a bundle of his things and burnt them. It was November and the bonfire was going. All night I smelt them smouldering.

W1
Mercy, mercy—

W2
Yes.

M
Then I began to smell her off him again. Yes.

M
Would you like me to scratch you? Are you going to have a little bit of grit?

W1
When first this change I actually thanked God. I thought, It is done,. Now we are going to know a beauty left in the world. And you can’t go far. Perhaps I could have said it is the Protestant thing to do.

W2
Will you not kiss me?

W1
Or you will weary of me.

M
Have you could not have waited a little of time?

W2
Less confused. Less confusing. At the same time I prefer this to… the other thing. Definitely. There are endurable moments.

M
I thought.

W2
No.

W1
Will you go?

M
I do.

W2
Give me up, as a bad job. Go away and start poking and pecking at someone else. On the other hand—

W1
Get off me! Get off me!

M
You will be needn’t get Ripped off me again?

W2
I will give you nothing more to eat.

M
Will you not try to move again?

W1
Is it that I do not tell the truth, is that it, that some day somehow I may tell the truth at last and then no more light at last, for the truth?

W2
You might get angry and blaze me clean out of my wits. Mightn't you?

M
I know now, all that was just… play. And all this? When will all this—

W1
Then we’ll die. I’ll go and get the sheet.

W2
I can’t go without my things.

M
All this, when will all this have been… just play?

W1
I can do nothing… for anybody… any more… thank God. So it must be something I have to say. How the mind works still!

W2
Is that it?

M
Perhaps they have become friends. Perhaps sorrow—

W1
But I have said all I can. All you let me. All I—

M
But for something.

W2
But I doubt it. It would not be like you somehow. And you must know I am doing my best. Perhaps I could sleep on and off with her feet, in the dark Miss Fitt, I fancy. Shall I myself not melt perhaps in the end, or burn, oh I do not mean necessarily burst into flames, no, just little by little be charred to a black cinder, all this – – visible flesh. On the other hand, did I ever know a temperate time? No. I speak of temperate times and torrid times, they are empty words. I speak of when I was not yet caught – in this way – and had my legs and had the use of my legs, and could seek out a shady place, like you, when I was tired of the sun, or a sunny place when was tired of the shade, like you, and they are all empty words. It is no hotter today than yesterday, it will be no hotter tomorrow than today, how could it, and so on back into the far past, forward into the far future. And should one day the earth cover my breasts, then I shall never have seen my breasts, no one ever seen my breasts. I hope you caught something of that, Willie, I should be sorry to think you had caught nothing of all that, it is not every day I rise to

M
No, I cannot, if not better.

W2
Are you listening to me? Is anyone bothering about me at all?

M
Not even a squeeze of—

W1
Is it something I should do with my face, other than utter? Weep?

W2
She always say it is.

W1
Bite off my tongue and swallow it? Spit it out? Would that placate you? How the mind works still to be sure!

M
Meet, and sit, now in the one dear place, now in the other, and sorrow together, and compare—
(Hiccup)
 pardon— happy memories.

W1
Is it something I should do with my face, other than utter? That it’s the worst, I know. She should be getting stuck, if she’s not dead.

W2
That poor creature who tried to seduce you, what ever became of her, do you suppose?—I can hear her. Poor thing.

M
Personally I always preferred Lipton's.

W1
And that all is falling, all fallen, from the beginning, on empty air. Nothing being asked at all. No one asking me for anything at all.

W2
If only I could think, There is no sense in this … either, none whatsoever. I can’t.

W1
And Rosie Plumpton bonny Rosie staring up at the lid these thirty years she must be now.

W2
Personally I always preferred Lipton’s.

M
I pity them in any case, yes, compare my lot with theirs, however blessed, and—

W1
They might even feel sorry for me, if they could see me. But never so sorry as I for them.

M
That poor creature who tried to seduce you, what ever became of her, do you suppose?–I can hear her. Poor thing.

W2
What do you do when you go out? Shift?

M
Am I hiding something? Have I lost—

W1
I can’t. The mind won’t have it. It would have to go. Yes.

W2
I can’t go on like this.

W2
Kill it and strain again.

M
Do you want me to pull off my trousers?

W2
She had means, I fancy, though she lived like a pig.

W1
What’s she blathering about?

M
Why go down? Why not—

W2
Have you too light?

W1
Perhaps she is sitting somewhere, by the open window, her hands folded in her lap, gazing down out over the olives—

M
Why not keep on glaring at me without ceasing? I might start to rave and—
(Hiccup)
—bring it up for you. Par—

W2
No.

M
I don’t know.

W1
No.

M
To think we were never together.

W2
Am I not perhaps a little unhinged already?

W1
You dreamt it’s the opposite.

M
That’s how it is.

W1
You promise?

W2
You dreamt it’s the worst it’s to take.

M
He’s tired of our goings on, I don’t like that.

W1
Silence and darkness were all I craved. Well, I get a certain amount of both. They being one. Perhaps it is more wickedness to pray for more.

M
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting on my oars, they lolling on air-pillows in the stern… sheets. Drifting. Such fantasies.

W1
Hellish half-light.

W2
A disgrace slawl on the river, I trust.

M
I’ll give you a sugar-plum per caput since it’s too much.

W1
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting on my oars, they lolling on air-pillows in the stern … sheets. Drifting. Such fantasies.

M
Hellish half-light.

W2
A shade gone. In the head. Just a shade. I doubt it.

W1
Yes, and the whole thing there, all there, staring you in the face. You will see it. Get off me. Or weary.

M
Yes, it’s too soon.

W1
Hellish half-light.

M
A shade gone. In the head. Just a shade the head. At my eyes and back to tell her I could see her back.

W2
(Laugh)

M
Mere eye. No mind. Opening and shutting on me. Am I as much—

M
As I much as… being seen?
