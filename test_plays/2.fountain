W1
I said to him, Give her up— 

W2
One Morning as I was sitting— 

M
It was all over eight of steps.

W1
I said to him, Give her up. I swore by all I held most sacred—

W2
It was all over I went to have a gloat. Not another soul to do not believe in the society met at all.

M
We were not long together when she smelled the rat. Give up that whore, she said, or I'll cut my throat—
(Hiccup)
pardon—so help me God. I knew she could have no proof. So I told her I did not know what she was talking about.

W2
What are you talking about? I said, stitching away. Someone yours? Give up whom? I smell you off him, she screamed, he stinks of bitch.

W1
Kiss me!

M
What have you to complain of… I said. Have I been neglecting you? How could we be together in the way we are if there were someone else? Loving her as I did, with all my heart, I could not but feel sorry for her.

W2
Fearing she was about to offer me violence I rang for Erskine and had her shown out. Her parting words, as he could testify, if he is still living, and has not forgotten, coming and going on the earth, letting people in, showing people out, were to the effect that she would settle my hash. I confess this did alarm me a little, at the time.

M
She was not convinced. I might have known. I smell her off you, she kept saying. There was no answer to this. So I took her in my arms and swore I could not live without her. I meant it, what is more. Yes, I am sure I did. She did not repulse me.

W1
Though I had him dogged for months by a first-rate man, no shadow of proof was forthcoming. And there was no denying that he continued as … assiduous as ever. This, and his horror of the merely Platonic thing, made me sometimes wonder if I were not accusing him unjustly. Yes.

M
Kiss you? In public? On the Assizes? Sponge you down? Moisten your fiddle down? Sponge you down? Moisten your poor lips? Pray with you? For you? Again. There is no more trees … he could never … he disappeared without her. I meant it, what is more. It was not sufficient. That meant she had gone away to give her a good beating, at the end of the day.

W2
Why don't you get out, I said, when he started moaning about his home life, there is obviously nothing between you any more. Or is there?

W1
I confess my first feeling was one of wonderment. What a male!

M
(Pause)

W2
What have you to complain of? I said. Have I been neglecting you? How could we be together in the way we are if there were someone else?

M
The next thing was the scene between them. I can't have her crashing in here, she said, threatening to take my life. I must have looked incredulous. Ask Erskine, she said, if you don't believe me. But she threatens to take her own, I said. Not yours? she said. No, I said, hers. We had fun trying to work this out.

W1
Then I forgave him. To what will love not stoop! I suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or our darling Grand Canary. He was looking pale. Peaked. But this was not possible just then. Professional commitments.

W2
She came again. Just strolled in. All honey. Licking her lips. Poor thing. I was doing my nails, by the open window. He has told me all about it, she said. Who he, I said filing away, and what it? I know what torture you must be going through, she said, and I have dropped in to say I bear you no ill-feeling. I rang for Erskine.

M
How much longer must we cart her into the world?

W1
When I was satisfied it was all over I went to have a gloat. Just a common tart. What he could have found in her when he had me—

W2
When he came again we had it out. I felt like death. He went on about why he had to tell her. Too risky and so on. That meant he had gone back to her. Back to that!

W1
Pudding face, puffy, spots, blubber mouth, jowls, no neck, drugs you could—

W2
He went on and on. I could hear a mower. An old hand mower. I stopped him and said that whatever I might feel I had no silly threats to offer—but not much stomach for her leavings either. He thought that over for a bit.

W1
Calves like a flunkey—

M
When he came again we had it out. I felt like death. He went on about why he had to tell her. Too risky and so on. That meant he had gone back to her. Back to that!

W2
The only solution was to go away together. He swore we should as soon as he had put his affairs in order. In the meantime we were to carry on as before. By that he meant as best we could.

W1
So he was mine again. All mine. I was happy again. I went about singing. The world—

M
Calves like a flunkey–

W1
When I saw her again she knew. She was looking––wretched. Pardon. Some fool was cutting grass. A little rush, then another. The problem was how to convince her that no … revival of intimacy was involved. I couldn’t. I might have known. So I took her in my arms and said I could not go on living without her. I don’t believe I could have.

W2
When he stopped coming I was prepared. More or less.

M
So he was mine again. All mine. I was happy again. I went about singing. The world–

W1
At home all heart to heart, new leaf and bygones bygones. I ran into your ex-doxy, she said one night, on the pillow, you’re well out of that. Rather uncalled for, I thought. I am indeed, sweetheart, I said, I am indeed. God what vermin women. Thanks to you, angel, I said.

M
I simply could no longer—

W2
I made a bundle of his things and burnt them. It was November and the bonfire was going. All night I smelt them smouldering.

W1
Finally it was all too much. I simply could no longer–

W2
 flown … home. I home.

M
hen I began to smell her off him again. Yes.

M
When first this change I actually thanked God. I thought, It is done, it is said, now all is going out—

W1
Mercy, mercy, tongue still hanging out for mercy. It will come. You haven't seen me. But you will. Then it will come.

W2
To say I am not disappointed, no, I am. I had anticipated something better. More restful.

W1
Or you will weary of me.

M
Down, all going down, into the dark, peace is coming, I thought, after all, at last, I was right, after all, thank God, when first this change.

W2
Less confused. Less confusing. At the same time I prefer this to… the other thing. Definitely. There are endurable moments.

M
I thought.

W2
When you go out—and I go out. Some day you will tire of me and go out… for good.

W1
Hellish half-light.

M
Peace, yes, I suppose, a kind of peace, and all that pain as if… never been.

W2
Give me up, as a bad job. Go away and start poking and pecking at someone else. On the other hand—

W1
Get off me! Get off me!

M
It will come. Must come. There is no future in this.

W2
Peace, for the time being, I mean.

M
Oh of course I know now—

W1
Is it that you want? There will be no future in this.

W2
You might get angry and blaze me clean out of my wits. Mightn't you?

M
On the other hand it will be possible.

W1
Is that it?

W2
Is it that you want me to take you on my knees?

M
All this, when will all this have been… just play?

W1
I can do nothing… for anybody… any more… thank God. So it must be something I have to say. How the mind works still!

W2
But I doubt it. It would not be like you somehow. And you must know I am doing my best. Or don't you?

M
Mightn’t you?

W1
May I sit beside you?

M
I can do nothing … for anybody … any more … thank God. So it must be something I have to say. How the mind works still!

W2
But I doubt it. It would not be like you somehow. And you must know I am doing my best. Or don’t you?

M
Perhaps they have become friends. Perhaps sorrow–

W2
Do you not want your combination of the lard?

M
Not even a squeeze of—

W1
Is it something I should do with my face, other than utter? Weep?

W2
Perhaps they have become friends. Perhaps sorrow–

W1
Bite off my tongue and swallow it? Spit it out? Would that placate you? How the mind works still to be sure!

M
Meet, and sit, now in the one dear place, now in the other, and sorrow together, and compare—
(Hiccup)
 pardon— happy memories.

W1
If only I could think. There is no sense in this… either, none whatsoever. I can't.

W2
Am I hiding something? Have I lost–

M
Personally I always preferred Lipton's.

W1
And that all is falling, all fallen, from the beginning, on empty air. Nothing being asked at all. No one asking me for anything at all.

W2
They might even feel sorry for me, if they could see me. But never so sorry as I for them.

W1
Try.

W2
She had means, it was said, hers presumably, none ever been struck, the carriage of a head for example, bowed when one would have thought it should be lifted, and vice versa, or a hand suspended in mid-air, as if unowned. That kind of thing. But with your father sitting on the rock that day nothing of the kind, no detail you could put your finger on and say, How very peculiar! No, I could never make it out. Perhaps, as I said, great mercies. I could never make it out. the sun, and the moon, that’s the way it is. The best’s to come, you know how it is. And should be asked? So much the worse for me. That’s what I call light –

M
I pity them in any case, yes, compare my lot with theirs, however blessed, and—

W1
I can't. The mind won't have it. It would have to go. Yes.

M
Pity them.

W2
What do you do when you go out? Shift?

M
Am I hiding something? Have I lost—

W1
She had means, I fancy, though she lived like a pig.

W2
Pity them.

W2
Kill it and strain again.

M
Have I lost… the thing you want? Why go out? Why go—

W2
She had means!

W1
Perhaps she has taken him away to live… somewhere in the sun.

M
What is it?

W2
Have you had gone out? Why go–

W1
Perhaps she is sitting somewhere, by the open window, her hands folded in her lap, gazing down out over the olives—

M
Yes, I fancy!

W2
Why go down? Why not–

M
—don

W1
Gazing down out over the olives, then the sea, wondering what can be keeping him, growing cold. Shadow stealing over everything. Creeping. Yes.

M
Why not keep away from wall?

W2
Couldn’t tell you. If we dropped him? If we dropped him?

W1
I don’t know.

M
Never woke together, on a May morning, the first to wake to wake the other two. Then in a little dinghy—

W1
To think we were never together.

W2
I say, Am I not perhaps a little unhinged already? Just a little? I doubt it.

M
A little dinghy—

W1
Silence and darkness were all I craved. Well, I get a certain amount of both. They being one. Perhaps it is more wickedness to pray for more.

M
Penit?

W1
Hellish half-light.

W2
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting to o o’er I gave me up by myself. The air is much greater. Am I within reach of your manure and let me go, the pull is so great, yes, crack all round me and let me out. Don’t you ever have that feeling, Willie, of being sucked up? Don’t you have to cling on sometimes, Willie? Willie.

M
Silence and darkness were all I craved. Well, I get a certain amount of both. They being one. Perhaps it is more wickedness to pray for more.

W1
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting on my oars, they lolling on air-pillows in the stern … sheets. Drifting. Such fantasies.

M
The air is much greater. Am I out of any help before you go far.

W2
You could hang on to high again, like the others? No. Not now. No no.

W1
Yes, and the whole thing there, all there, staring you in the face. You will see it. Get off me. Or weary.

M
And now, that you are… mere eye. Just looking. At my face. On and off.

W1
Weary of playing with me. Get off me. Yes.

M
Couldn’t hear me screaming again?

W2
(Laugh)

M
Mere eye. No mind. Opening and shutting on me. Am I as much—

M
Am I as much?
