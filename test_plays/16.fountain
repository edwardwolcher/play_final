W1
Dump!

W2
One Morning as I was sitting— 

M
We were not long together—

W1
It was all over I went about singing.

W2
It was all over I went about singing.

M
Now the boy wonder if he was not live all her money.

W2
What are you talking about? I said, stitching away. Someone yours? Give up whom? I smell you off him, she screamed, he stinks of bitch.

W1
Though I had him dogged for months by a first-rate man, no shadow of proof was forthcoming. And there was no denying that he continued as… assiduous as ever. This, and his horror of the merely Platonic thing, made me sometimes wonder if I were not accusing him unjustly. Yes.

M
That’s right, I summer, with the steps. I left before the gawd asks you where.

W2
Fearing she was about to offer me violence I rang for Erskine and had her shown out. Her parting words, as he could testify, if he is still living, and has not forgotten, coming and going on the earth, letting people in, showing people out, were to the effect that she would settle my hash. I confess this did alarm me a little, at the time.

M
She was!

W1
Though I had him dogged for months by a first-rate man, no shadow of proof was forthcoming. And there was no denying that he continued as … assiduous as ever. This, and his horror of the merely Platonic thing, made me sometimes wonder if I were not accusing him unjustly. Yes.

M
What have you to complain of? I said. Have I been neglect, if that my sufferings have ceased. No living with us.

W2
Why don't you get out, I said, when he started moaning about his home life, there is obviously nothing between you any more. Or is there?

W1
I confess my first feeling was one of wonderment. What a male!

M
(Pause)

W2
What have you to complain of? I said. Have I been neglect you? How could we be together in the way we are if there were someone else? Loving us, whether it or not.

M
Ah there you are, the worse.

W1
I confess it is. What it?

W2
Anything between us, he very beginning to be the edge of us before its time.

M
Then I got frightened and made a clean breast of it. She was looking more and more desperate. She had a razor in her vanity-bag. Adulterers, take warning, never admit.

W1
When I was satisfied it was all over I went to have a gloat. Just a common tart. What he could have found in her when he had me—

W2
My little order! Crucify me before it with your arms.

W1
Pudding face, puffy, spots, blubber mouth, jowls, no neck, drugs you could—

W2
He went on and on. I could hear a mower. An old hand mower. I stopped him and said that whatever I might feel I had no silly threats to offer—but not much stomach for her leavings either. He thought that over for a bit.

W1
Calves like a flunkey—

M
When he could have it out. I felt like death. He went on about why he had to tell her. Too risky and so on. That meant he had gone back to her. Back to that!

W2
Your friends!

W1
So he was mine again. All mine. I was happy again. I went about singing. The world—

M
Calves like a flunkey–

W1
When I saw her again she knew. She was looking––wretched. Pardon. Some fool was cutting grass. A little rush, then another. The problem was how to convince her that no … revival of intimacy was involved. I couldn’t. I might have known. So I took her in my arms and said I could not go on living without her. I don’t believe she could have.

W2
When he stopped coming I was prepared. More or less.

M
Finally it was all too much. I simply could no longer—

W1
Before I could do anything he disappeared. That meant she had won. That slut! I couldn't credit it. I lay stricken for weeks. Then I drove over to her place. It was all bolted and barred. All grey with frozen dew. On the way back by Ash and Snodland—

M
I simply could no longer—

W2
The only solution was to go away together. He swore we should as soon as he had put his affairs in order. In the meantime we were to carry on as before. By that he meant as best we could.

W1
Finally it was all too much. I simply could no longer–

W2
Yes, you could not be if I came –

M
I simply could no longer–

M
Likely!

W1
Mercy, mercy, tongue still hanging out for mercy. It will come. You haven't seen me. But you will. Then it will come.

W2
Before I could do anything he disappeared. That meant she had won. That slut! I couldn’t credit it. I lay stricken for weeks, sulky little bastard, you could not bewitching you till it began to fandaken. But mine suppose could not live without her. I meant it, what is more. Yes, I am sure I did. She heard you in my deep sleep. There is no sleep so deep I would not hear you there. One two.

W1
Or you will weary of me.

M
Don’t go about me again.

W2
What’ll I do?

M
I thought.

W2
One only like the one.

W1
Hellish half-light.

M
You dreamt it.

W2
You dreamt it.

W1
That would be better idea.

M
It will come. Must come. There is no future in this.

W2
On the other hand things may disimprove, there is that danger.

M
Oh of course I know now—

W1
No, no, impossible.

W2
You might get angry and blaze me clean out of my wits. Mightn't you?

M
On the other hand things may disimprove, there is that danger.

W1
Don’t tell me.

W2
Mightn't you?

M
All this, when will all this have been… just play?

W1
I can do nothing… for anybody… any more… thank God. So it must be something I have to say. How the mind works still!

W2
Oh of course I know now–

M
Perhaps they have become friends. Perhaps sorrow—

W1
All right.

M
Perhaps sorrow has brought them together.

W2
But I doubt it. It would not be like you somehow. And you must know I am doing my best. No?

M
Is not I, Christy?

W2
But mine? Did you say, I have shed my hair, if it would be better on us, Do you know what I dream sometimes? What I dream sometimes, Willie. That … … I never could … If I listened long enough I’d hear it, a string would give.

M
He can’t go far.

W1
No doubt I make the same mistake as when it was the sun that shone, of looking for sense where possibly there is none.

W2
Am I taboo, I wonder. Not necessarily, now that all danger is averted. That poor creature—I can hear her—that poor creature—

W1
Bite off my tongue and swallow it? Spit it out? Would that placate you? How the mind works still to be sure!

M
Your harp? What’s all this about? Abused to be good, if I had an appointment with a Godin … God … anyhow, you see who I mean, I’d wait till it was black night before I gave up. I’d like very much to sit down, but I don’t quite know how to go about it.

W1
That would be too bad, really too bad. Wouldn’t it, Didi, be really too bad? When must all the beauty of the way. And the goodness of the wayfarers. Wouldn’t it, Didi?

W2
That poor creature who tried to seduce you, what ever became of her, do you suppose?—I can hear her. Poor thing.

M
Bite off my tongue and swallow it? Spit it out? Would that placate you? How the mind works still to be sure!

W1
Meet, and sit, now in the other, and sorrow together, and compare– pardon–happy memories.

W2
Could I be of any help?

W1
Calm yourself.

W2
Kissing their sour kisses.

M
I pity them in any case, yes, compare my lot with theirs, however blessed, and—

W1
I can't. The mind won't have it. It would have to go. Yes.

M
Pity them.

W2
Will you not kiss them in the least, perhaps I have said, hers at all.

M
Am I hiding something? Have I lost—

W1
She had means, I fancy, though she lived like a pig.

W2
Like dragging a great roller, on a scorching day. The strain… to get it moving, momentum coming—

W2
Kill it and strain again.

M
What was I saying?

W2
She said. Who he, I said filing away, and what it? I know what torture you must be going to be going to be buried there in my sun, with now and then a dust bath, and then–bang!–all her troubles over. All the laying and the hatching. Just one great squawk and then … peace. They would have slit her weasand in any case. Here we are, let me down. What are you up to now, Mr Slocum? We are at a standstill, all danger is past and you blow your horn. Now if instead of blowing it now you had blown it at that unfortunate–

W1
Like dragging a great roller, on a scorching day.

M
Perhaps I could have gone back, up by the meanest train on the line and shut out the truckpath. The best would be the ruin now, Mr Slocum, and help me from.

W2
Have you no respect for misery? Minnie! Little Minnie!

W1
Perhaps she is sitting somewhere, by the open window, her hands folded in her lap, gazing down out over the olives—

M
Why not keep on glaring at me without ceasing? I might start to rave and—
(Hiccup)
—bring it up for you. Par—

W2
It would be like yesterday, on a day.

M
—don

W1
Gazing down out over the olives, then the sea, wondering what can be keeping him, growing cold. Shadow stealing over everything. Creeping. Yes.

M
To think we were never together.

W2
Then I could go on like this.

W1
It’s how it is.

M
Never woke together, on a May morning, the first to wake to wake the other two. Then in a little dinghy—

W1
Penitence, yes, at a pinch, atonement, one was resigned, but no, that does not seem to be the point either.

W2
I say, Am I not perhaps a little unhinged already? Just a little? I doubt it.

M
Would you like me to change your position again?

W1
Time to be it now?

M
Penitence, I wonder.

W1
I say, Am I not perhaps a little unhinged already? Just a little? I doubt it.

W2
A shade gone. In the head. Just a shade. I doubt it.

M
We were not civilized.

W1
Day… night… It seems like yesterday must have been.

M
Such fantasies. Then. And now—

W2
I doubt it. 
(Laugh)

W1
Yes, and the whole thing there, all there, staring you in the face. You will see it. Get off me. Or weary.

M
And now, that you are… mere eye. Just looking. At my face. On and off.

W1
Weary of playing with me. Get off me. Yes.

M
Looking for something. In my face. Some truth. In my eyes. Not even.

W2
He hands. In spite of everything else. No need to take everything literally.

M
Mere eye. No mind. Opening and shutting on me. Am I as much—

M
Am I as much in any case to see?
