W1
Yes perhaps a shade gone I suppose some might say

W2
One Morning as I was sitting— 

M
Consult his happy returns. Getting up in that case.

W1
It’s a how clear he had put on the forceps.

W2
Shivering in the park, drowned in dreams and burning to be gone. Not a soul. Last fancies. Keep ’em under! Scalded the eyes out of me reading Effie again, a page a day, with tears again. Effie…. Could have been happy with her, up there on the Baltic, and the pines, and the dunes. Could I? And she? Pah! Fanny came in a couple of times. Bony old ghost of a whore. Couldn’t do much, but I suppose better than a kick in the crutch. The last time wasn’t so bad. How do you manage it, she said, at your age? I told her I’d been saving up for her all my life. Went to Vespers once, like when I was in short trousers. 

M
We were not long together when she smelled the rat. Give up that whore, she said, or I'll cut my throat—
(Hiccup)
pardon—so help me God. I knew she could have no proof. So I told her I did not know what she was talking about.

W2
Now the day is over

W1
Now the day is over,

M
But the later he was sitting on a rock looking out of the open window.

W2
Now the day is over,

M
She was not convinced. I might have known. I smell her off you, she kept saying. There was no answer to this. So I took her in my arms and swore I could not live without her. I meant it, what is more. Yes, I am sure I did. She did not repulse me.

W1
Judge then of my astonishment when one fine morning, as I was sitting stricken in the morning room, he slunk in, fell on his knees before me, buried his face in my lap and… confessed.

M
She put a bloodhound on me, but I had a little chat with him. He was glad of the extra money.

W2
Why don't you get out, I said, when he started moaning about his home life, there is obviously nothing between you any more. Or is there?

W1
Night is drawing nigh-igh,

M
Judge then of my astonishment when one fine morning, as I was sitting stricken in the morning room, he slunk in, fell on his knees before me, buried his face in my lap and … confessed.

W2
Anything between us, he said, what do you take me for, a something machine? And of course with him no danger of the… spiritual thing. Then why don't you get out? I said. I sometimes wondered if he was not living with her for her money.

M
Why don’t you get out, I said, when he started moaning about his home life, there is obviously nothing between you any more. Or is there?

W1
Then I forgave him. To what will love not stoop! I suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or our darling Grand Canary. He was looking pale. Peaked. But this was not possible just then. Professional commitments.

W2
Shadows––of the evening

M
Then I got frightened and made a clean breast of it. She was looking more and more desperate. She had a razor in her vanity-bag. Adulterers, take warning, never admit.

W1
The next thing was the scene between them. I can’t have her crashing in here, she said, threatening to take my life. I must have looked incredulous. Ask Erskine, she said, if you don’t believe me. But she threatens to take her own, I said. Not yours? she said. No, I said filing away, hers. We had fun trying to work this out.

W2
I confess my first feeling was one of wonderment. What a male!

W1
She came again. Just strolled in. All honey. Licking her lips. Poor thing. I was doing my nails, by the open window. He has told me all about it, she said. Who he, I said filing away, and what it? I know what torture you must be going through, she said, and I have dropped in to say I bear you no ill-feeling. I rang for Erskine.

W2
Steal across the trash

W1
When I was satisfied it was all over I went about how could you have responded if you were not guilty or couldn’t have been neglect gems of you.

M
Then I forgave him. To what will love not stoop! I suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or our darling Grand Canary. He was looking pale. Peaked. But this was not possible just then. Professional commitments.

W2
Anything between us, he said, what do you take me for, a something machine? And of course with him no danger of the … spiritual thing. Then why don’t you get out? I said. I sometimes wondered if he was not living with her for her money.

W1
Then I got frightened and made a clean breast of it. She was looking more and more desperate. She had a razor in her vanity-bag. Adulterers, take warning, never admit.

M
At home all heart to heart, new leaf and bygones bygones. I ran into your ex- doxy, she said one night, on the pillow, you're well out of that. Rather uncalled for, I thought. I am indeed, sweetheart, I said, I am indeed. God what vermin women. Thanks to you, angel, I said.

W1
Then I began to smell her off him again. Yes.

W2
When he stopped coming I was prepared. More or less.

M
The next thing was the scene between them. I can’t have her crashing in here, she said, threatening to take my life. I must have looked incredulous. Ask Erskine, she said, if you don’t believe me. But she threatens to take her own, I said. Not yours? she said. No, I said. We had fun trying to work this out.

W1
Before I could do anything he disappeared. That meant she had won. That slut! I couldn't credit it. I lay stricken for weeks. Then I drove over to her place. It was all bolted and barred. All grey with frozen dew. On the way back by Ash and Snodland—

M
I simply could no longer—

W2
I made a bundle of his things and burnt them. It was November and the bonfire was going. All night I smelt them smouldering.

W1
Mercy, mercy—

W2
Then I forgave him. To what will love not stoop! I suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or our darling Grand Canary. He was looking pale. Peaked. But this was not possible that. Professional commitments.

M
I could have sworn we were only on the sixth. We didn’t get it in till 1925 now.

M
When first this change I actually thanked God. I thought, It is done, it is said, now all is going out—

W1
Mercy, mercy, tongue still hanging out for mercy. It will come. You haven't seen me. But you will. Then it will come.

W2
My Lord.

W1
She came again. Just strolled in. All honey. Licking her lips. Poor thing. I was doing my nails, by the open window. He has told me all about it, she said. Who he, I said filing away, and what it? I know what torture you must be going through, she said, and I have dropped in to say I bear you no one else. I rang for Erskine.

M
Down, all going down, into the dark, peace is coming, I thought, after all, at last, I was right, after all, thank God, when first this change.

W2
Less confused. Less confusing. At the same time I prefer this to… the other thing. Definitely. There are endurable moments.

M
To say I am not disappointed, no, I have. I had anticipated something better. More restful.

W2
Bob.

W1
Hellish half-light.

M
Peace, yes, I suppose, a kind of peace, and all that pain as if… never been.

W2
I thought.

W1
Get off me! Get off me!

M
It will come. Must come. There is no future in this.

W2
On the other hand things may disimprove, there is that danger.

M
Oh of course I know now—

W1
Is it that I do not tell the truth, is that it, that some day somehow I may tell the truth at last and then no more light at last, for the truth?

W2
I will tell you things at all!

M
On the other hand things may disimprove, there is that that what I find so wonderful, that not out of the bag. The bag. Could I enumerate its contents? No.

W1
Is that it?

W2
Mightn't you?

M
You might get angry and blaze me all out of my wits. Might’t it, Didi, no, just little by little?

W1
Finish your own!

W2
Two knobs?

M
Perhaps they have become friends. Perhaps sorrow—

W1
But I have said all I can. All you let me. All I—

M
That would be too bad, really too bad. Wouldn’t it, Didi?

W2
Moron!

M
Perhaps they meet, and sit, over a cup of that green tea they both so loved, without milk or sugar not even a squeeze of lemon—

W2
But I have said, all I can. All I-

M
Not even a squeeze of—

W1
I’m listening.

W2
If you like company a man I would trust it as well, and you see –

W1
Bite off my tongue and swallow it? Spit it out? Would that placate you? How the mind works still to be sure!

M
Meet, and sit, now in the one dear place, now in the other, and sorrow together, and compare—
(Hiccup)
 pardon— happy memories.

W1
If only I could think. There is no sense in this… either, none whatsoever. I can't.

W2
What the memory–

M
Ah! The Clerk!

W1
Meet, and sit, now in the other, and sorrow together, and compare– pardon–happy memories.

W2
If only I could think, There is no sense in this … either, none whatsoever. I can’t.

W1
That poor creature who tried to seduce you, what ever became of her, do you suppose?–I can hear her. Poor thing.

W2
Kissing their sour kisses.

M
He is going to commit, the way or t’other, no.

W1
I can't. The mind won't have it. It would have to go. Yes.

M
That poor creature who tried to seduce you, what ever became of her, do you suppose?–I can hear her. Poor thing.

W2
Personally I always preferred Lipton’s.

M
Am I hiding something? Have I lost—

W1
She had means, I fancy, though she lived like a pig.

W2
Like dragging a great roller, on a scorching day. The strain… to get it moving, momentum coming—

W2
Personally I always preferred Lipton’s.

M
Have I lost… the thing you want? Why go out? Why go—

W2
She had means!

W1
Perhaps she has taken him away to live… somewhere in the sun.

M
Kill it and strain again.

W2
And that all is falling, all fallen, from the beginning, on empty air. Nothing being asked anywhere. No one asking me for anything at all.

W1
Perhaps she is sitting somewhere, by the open window, her hands folded in her lap, gazing down out over the olives—

M
Why not keep on glaring at me without ceasing? I might start to rave and—
(Hiccup)
—bring it up for you. Par—

W2
Why go down? Why not–

M
—don

W1
They might even feel sorry for me, if they could see me. But never so sorry as I for them.

M
Why not keep on glaring at me without ceasing? I might start to rave and––bring it up for you. Par–

W2
Am I not perhaps a little unhinged already?

W1
Poor creature. Poor creatures.

M
Gazing, over the olives, then the sea, wondering what can be keeping him, growing cold.

W1
Penitence, yes, at a pinch, atonement, one was resigned, but no, that does not seem to be the point either.

W2
I say, Am I not perhaps a little unhinged already? Just a little? I doubt it.

M
Poor creature.

W1
Silence and darkness were all I craved. Well, I get a certain amount of both. They being one. Perhaps it is more wickedness to pray for more.

M
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting on my oars, they lolling on air-pillows in the stern… sheets. Drifting. Such fantasies.

W1
Hellish half-light.

W2
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting my oars, they lolling on air-pillows in the stern … sheets. Drifting. Such fantasies.

M
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting on my oars, they lolling on air-pillows in the stern … sheets. Drifting. Such fantasies.

W1
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting on my oars, they lolling on air-pillows in the stern … sheets. Drifting. Such fantasies.

M
Such fantasies. Then. And now—

W2
A shade gone. In the head. Just a shade. I doubt it.

W1
Hellish half-light.

M
Hellish half-light.

W1
Weary of playing with me. Get off me. Yes.

M
Looking for something. In my face. Some truth. In my eyes. Not even.

W2
(Laugh)

M
Mere eye. No mind. Opening and shutting on me. Am I as much—

M
As I much as… being seen?
