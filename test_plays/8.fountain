W1
Yes perhaps a shade gone I suppose some might say

W2
One Morning as I was sitting— 

M
We were not long together—

W1
It was all over I went about singing.

W2
It was all over I went to get the swing.

M
We were not long together when she smelled the rat. Give up that whore, she said, or I'll cut my throat—
(Hiccup)
pardon—so help me God. I knew she could have no proof. So I told her I did not know what she was talking about.

W2
You could not be looking in the dark and the owl flown to hoot at someone else. On the log.

W1
Though I had him dogged for months by a first-rate man, no shadow of proof was forthcoming. And there was no denying that he continued as… assiduous as ever. This, and his horror of the merely Platonic thing, made me sometimes wonder if I were not accusing him unjustly. Yes.

M
My movements.

W2
Fearing she was about to offer me violence I rang for Erskine and had her shown out. Her parting words, as he could testify, if he is still living, and has not forgotten, coming and going on the earth, letting people in, showing people out, were to the effect that she would settle my hash. I confess this did alarm me a little, at the time.

M
She was not convinced. I might have known. I smell her off you, she kept saying. There was no answer to this. So I took her in my arms and swore I could not live without her. I meant it, what is more. Yes, I am sure I did. She did not repulse me.

W1
Yes.

M
What have you to complain of? I said. Have I been neglecting you? How could we be together in the way we are if there were someone else? Loving us that we were … … how we were not together – to be together, each one for himself.

W2
Why don't you get out, I said, when he started moaning about his home life, there is obviously nothing between you any more. Or is there?

W1
I confess my first feeling was one of wonderment. What a male!

M
Judge then of my astonishment when one fine morning, as I was sitting stricken in the morning room, he slunk in, fell on his knees before me, buried his face in my lap and … confessed.

W2
You promise?

M
The next thing was the scene between them. I can't have her crashing in here, she said, threatening to take my life. I must have looked incredulous. Ask Erskine, she said, if you don't believe me. But she threatens to take her own, I said. Not yours? she said. No, I said, hers. We had fun trying to work this out.

W1
Then I forgave him. To what will love not stoop! I suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or our darling Grand Canary. He was looking pale. Peaked. But this was not possible just then. Professional commitments.

W2
She came again. Just strolled in. All honey. Licking her lips. Poor thing. I was doing my nails, by the open window. He has told me all about it, she said. Who he, I said filing away, and what it? I know what torture you must be going through, she said, and I have dropped in to say I bear you no ill-feeling. I rang for Erskine.

M
Then I got frightened and made a clean breast of it. She was looking more and more desperate. She had a razor in her vanity-bag. Adulterers, take warning, never admit.

W1
When I was satisfied it was all over I went to have a gloat. Just a common tart. What he could have found in her when he had me—

W2
When he came again we had it out. I felt like death. He went on about why he had to tell her. Too risky and so on. That meant he had gone back to her. Back to that!

W1
Pudding face, puffy, spots, blubber mouth, jowls, no neck, drugs you could—

W2
He went on and on. I could hear a mower. An old hand mower. I stopped him and said that whatever I might feel I had no silly threats to offer—but not much stomach for her leavings either. He thought that over for a bit.

W1
Calves like a flunkey—

M
When I saw her again she knew. She was looking—
(Hiccup)
—wretched. Pardon. Some fool was cutting grass. A little rush, then another. The problem was how to convince her that no… revival of intimacy was involved. I couldn't. I might have known. So I took her in my arms and said I could not go on living without her. I don't believe I could have.

W2
The only solution was to go away together. He swore we should as soon as he had put his affairs in order. In the meantime we were to carry on as before. By that he meant as best we could.

W1
So he was mine again. All mine. I was happy again. I went about singing. The world—

M
At home all heart to heart, new leaf and bygones bygones. I ran into your ex- doxy, she said one night, on the pillow, you're well out of that. Rather uncalled for, I thought. I am indeed, sweetheart, I said, I am indeed. God what vermin women. Thanks to you, angel, I said.

W1
Then I began to smell her off him again. Yes.

W2
When he stopped coming I was prepared. More or less.

M
Finally it was all too much. I simply could no longer—

W1
Before I could do anything he disappeared. That meant she had won. That slut! I couldn't credit it. I lay stricken for weeks. Then I drove over to her place. It was all bolted and barred. All grey with frozen dew. On the way back by Ash and Snodland—

M
I simply could no longer—

W2
I made a bundle of his things and burnt them. It was November and the bonfire was going. All night I smelt them smouldering.

W1
Mercy, mercy—

W2
Yes, but it would be all too much. Do you want me to go away? Where is Addie?

M
I simply could no longer–

M
When first this change I actually thanked God. I thought, It is done, it is said, now all is going out—

W1
Mercy, mercy, tongue still hanging out for mercy. It will come. You haven't seen me. But you will. Then it will come.

W2
Yes.

W1
With her music master. Are you going to answer me today?

M
Down, all going down, into the dark, peace is coming, I thought, after all, at last, I was right, after all, thank God, when first this change.

W2
Less confused. Less confusing. At the same time I prefer this to… the other thing. Definitely. There are endurable moments.

M
To say I used to climb together. I saved his life once. I have not forgotten it.

W2
When you go out—and I go out. Some day you will tire of me and go out… for good.

W1
Hellish half-light.

M
Peace, yes, I suppose, a kind of peace, and all that pain as if… never been.

W2
Give me up, as a bad job. Go away and start poking and pecking at someone else. On the other hand—

W1
Get off me! Get off me!

M
Hellish half-light.

W2
On the other hand things may disimprove, there is that danger.

M
Oh of course I know now—

W1
Is it that I do not tell the truth, is that it, that some day somehow I may tell the truth at last and then no more light at last, for the truth?

W2
You might get angry and blaze me clean out of my wits. Mightn't you?

M
I know now, all that was just… play. And all this? When will all this—

W1
Is that it?

W2
Mightn't you?

M
All this, when will all this have been… just play?

W1
I can do nothing… for anybody… any more… thank God. So it must be something I have to say. How the mind works still!

W2
Now?

M
Maud would be like me somehow.

W1
But I have said all I can. All you let me. All I—

M
I can do nothing … for anybody living without any more … thank God. So it must be something I have to say. How the mind works still!

W2
No doubt I make the same mistake as when it was the sun that shone, of looking for sense where possibly there is none.

M
Wait for Godot.

W2
Are you listening to me? Is anyone bothering about me at all?

M
Not even a squeeze of—

W1
Is it something I should do with my face, other than utter? Weep?

W2
Am I taboo, I wonder. Not necessarily, now that all danger is averted. That poor creature—I can hear her—that poor creature—

W1
Ah! You’re not going to do me a service for nothing? I mean unconditionally? Good God! 

M
Meet, and sit, now in the one dear place, now in the other, and sorrow together, and compare—
(Hiccup)
 pardon— happy memories.

W1
Is it something I should do with my face, other than utter? Weep?

W2
That poor creature who tried to seduce you, what ever became of her, do you suppose?—I can hear her. Poor thing.

M
Bite off my tongue and swallow it? Spit it out? Would that placate you? How the mind works still to be sure to take advantage of the works of Pozzo and I cannot take it off again and then I put them on again and then I took them off again and then I took them on again and then I took them on again and then I took them on again and then I took them on again and then I took them off again and then I took them on again and then I put them on again and then I took them on again and then I took them off again and then I came here I took them on again and then I took them on again and then I took them off again and then I left me put them on again and then I took them on again and then I took them off again and then I took them on again and then I took them on again and then I took them off again and then I took them on again and then I took them down again and then I took them on again and then I took them on again and then I gave them on again and then I took them there you, the bastard! Now I put them on and then I put them on again and then I took them off again and then I took them on again and then I took them on again and then I put them on again and then I took them on again and then I took them off again and then I took them on again and then I put them on again and then I took them off again and then I took them on again and then I took them on again and then I put them on again and then I took them on again and then I took them off again and then I took them on again and then I put them on again and then I took them off again and then I put them on again and then I took them on again and then I took them off again and then I put them on again and then I took them on again and then I –

W1
And that all is falling, all fallen, from the beginning, on empty air. Nothing being asked at all. No one asking me for anything at all.

W2
They might even feel sorry for me, if they could see me. But never so sorry as I for them.

W1
I can't

W2
Kissing their sour kisses.

M
I pity them in any case, yes, compare my lot with theirs, however blessed, and—

W1
I can't. The mind won't have it. It would have to go. Yes.

M
Pity them.

W2
What do you do when you go out? Shift?

M
Am I hiding something? Have I lost—

W1
She had means, I fancy, though she lived like a pig.

W2
What’s happening?

W2
What?

M
Have I lost… the thing you want? Why go out? Why go—

W2
And you perhaps pitying me, thinking. Poor thing, she needs a rest.

W1
Like dragging a great roller, on a scorching day. The strain … to get it moving, momentum coming–

M
Why go down? Why not—

W2
I don't know.

W1
Perhaps she is sitting somewhere, by the open window, her hands folded in her lap, gazing down out over the olives—

M
Why not keep on glaring at me without ceasing? I might start to rave and—
(Hiccup)
—bring it up for you. Par—

W2
No.

M
—don

W1
Gazing down out over the olives, then the sea, wondering what can be keeping him, growing cold. Shadow stealing over everything. Creeping. Yes.

M
To think we were never together.

W2
Am I not perhaps a little unhinged already?

W1
Poor creature. Poor creatures.

M
To think we were never together.

W1
Penitence, yes, at a pinch, atonement, one was resigned, but no, that does not seem to be the point either.

W2
I say, Am I not perhaps a little unhinged already? Just a little? I doubt it.

M
A little dinghy—

W1
Silence and darkness were all I craved. Well, I get a certain amount of both. They being one. Perhaps it is more wickedness to pray for more.

M
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting on my oars, they lolling on air-pillows in the stern… sheets. Drifting. Such fantasies.

W1
Hellish half-light.

W2
A little dinghy, on the river, I resting on my oars, they lolling on air-pillows in the stern … sheets. Drifting. Such fantasies.

M
Give us what we could have done, it wouldn’t act.

W1
Dying for dark—and the darker the worse. Strange.

M
Hellish half-light.

W2
I doubt it. 
(Laugh)

W1
Hellish half-light.

M
In the vicinity.

W1
Such fantasies. Then. And now–

M
Looking for something. In my face. Some truth. In my eyes. Not even.

W2
(Laugh)

M
Mere eye. No mind. Opening and shutting on me. Am I as much—

M
But out of course of course the sky. The sun?
